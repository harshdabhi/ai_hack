Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\n\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\n\\nExamples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\n\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\n\\nExperiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\n\\nAfter fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\n\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\n\\nComparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\n\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategorization of human memory.\\n\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\n\\nComparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\n\\nA picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\n\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\n\\nPseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\n\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\n\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Approach to the Cardiac Patient\\nIntroduction\\nSymptoms or the physical examination may suggest a cardiovascular disorder. For confirmation, selectednoninvasive and invasive tests are usually done (see Ch. 207).\\nHistory\\nA thorough history is fundamental; it cannot be replaced by testing. The history must include a thoroughsystems review because many symptoms apparently occurring in other systems (eg, dyspnea,indigestion) are often caused by cardiac disease. A family history is taken because many cardiacdisorders (eg, coronary artery disease, systemic hypertension, bicuspid aortic valve, hypertrophiccardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse) have a heritable basis.\\nSerious cardiac symptoms include chest pain or discomfort, dyspnea (see p. 1832), weakness, fatigue,palpitations, light-headedness, sense of an impending faint, syncope, and edema. These symptomscommonly occur in more than one cardiac disorder and in noncardiac disorders.\\nPhysical Examination\\nComplete examination of all systems is essential to detect peripheral and systemic effects of cardiacdisorders and evidence of noncardiac disorders that might affect the heart. Examination includes thefollowing:\\n• Vital sign measurement\\n• Pulse palpation and auscultation\\n• Vein observation\\n• Chest inspection, percussion, auscultation, and palpation\\n• Cardiac percussion, palpation, and auscultation\\n• Lung examination (see p.1827)\\n• Extremity and abdomen examination\\nVital Signs\\nBP is measured in both arms and, for suspected congenital cardiac disorders or peripheral vasculardisorders, in both legs. The bladder of an appropriately sized cuff encircles 80% of the limb'scircumference, and the bladder's width is 40% of the circumference. The first sound heard as the Hgcolumn falls is systolic pressure; disappearance of the sound is diastolic pressure (5th-phase Korotkoffsound). Up to a 15 mm Hg pressure differential between the right and left arms is normal; a greaterdifferential suggests a vascular abnormality (eg, dissecting thoracic aorta) or a peripheral vasculardisorder. Leg pressure is usually 20 mm Hg higher than arm pressure. Ankle-brachial index (ratio of ankleto arm systolic BP) is normally > 1. A Doppler probe may be used to measure the ankle BP if the pedalpulses are not easily palpable.\\nHeart rate and rhythm are assessed by palpating the carotid or radial pulse or by cardiac auscultation ifarrhythmia is suspected; some heartbeats during arrhythmias may be audible but do not generate apalpable pulse.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 206.

The rateincreases in patients with heart failure or anxiety and decreases or becomes intermittent in the moribund.Shallow, rapid respirations may indicate pleuritic pain.\\nTemperature may be elevated by acute rheumatic fever or cardiac infection (eg, endocarditis). After MI,low grade fever is very common. Other causes are sought only if fever persists > 72 h.\\nOrthostatic changes: BP and heart rate are measured with the patient supine, seated, and standing; a1-min interval is needed between each change in position. A difference of ≤ 10 mm Hg is normal; thedifference tends to be a little greater in the elderly due to loss of vascular elasticity.\\nPulsus paradoxus: Normally during inspiration, systolic arterial BP can decrease as much as 10 mm Hg,and pulse rate increases to compensate. A greater decrease in systolic BP or weakening of the pulseduring inspiration is considered pulsus paradoxus. Pulsus paradoxus occurs in\\n• Cardiac tamponade (commonly)\\n• Constrictive pericarditis, severe asthma, and COPD (occasionally)\\n• Restrictive cardiomyopathy, severe pulmonary embolism, and hypovolemic shock (rarely)\\nBP decreases during inspiration because negative intrathoracic pressure increases venous return andhence right ventricular (RV) filling; as a result, the interventricular septum bulges slightly into the leftventricular (LV) outflow tract, decreasing cardiac output and thus BP. This mechanism (and the drop insystolic BP) is exaggerated in disorders that cause high negative intrathoracic pressure (eg, asthma) orthat restrict RV filling (eg, cardiac tamponade, cardiomyopathy) or outflow (eg, pulmonary embolism).\\nPulsus paradoxus is quantified by inflating a BP cuff to just above systolic BP and deflating it very slowly(eg, ≤ 2 mm Hg/heartbeat). The pressure is noted when Korotkoff sounds are first heard (at first, onlyduring expiration) and when Korotkoff sounds are heard continuously. The difference between thepressures is the \"amount\" of pulsus paradoxus.\\nPulses\\nPeripheral pulses: Major peripheral pulses in the arms and legs are palpated for symmetry and volume(intensity); elasticity of the arterial wall is noted. Absence of pulses may suggest an arterial disorder (eg,atherosclerosis) or systemic embolism. Peripheral pulses may be difficult to feel in obese or muscularpeople. The pulse has a rapid upstroke, then collapses in disorders with a rapid runoff of arterial blood(eg, arteriovenous communication, aortic regurgitation). The pulse is rapid and bounding in thyrotoxicosisand hypermetabolic states; it is slow and sluggish in myxedema. If pulses are asymmetric, auscultationover peripheral vessels may detect a bruit due to stenosis.\\nCarotid pulses: Observation, palpation, and auscultation of both carotid pulses may suggest a specificdisorder (seeTable 206-1).\\n[Table 206-1. Carotid Pulse Amplitude and Associated Disorders]\\nAging and arteriosclerosis lead to vessel rigidity, which tends to eliminate the characteristic findings. Invery young children, the carotid pulse may be normal, even when severe aortic stenosis is present.\\nAuscultation over the carotid arteries can distinguish murmurs from bruits. Murmurs originate in the heartor great vessels and are usually louder over the upper precordium and diminish toward the neck. Bruitsare higher-pitched, are heard only over the arteries, and seem more superficial. An arterial bruit must bedistinguished from a venous hum. Unlike an arterial bruit, a venous hum is usually continuous, heard bestwith the patient sitting or standing, and is eliminated by compression of the ipsilateral internal jugular vein.\\nVeins\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 206.

An AVM or ashunt produces a continuous murmur (heard on auscultation) and often a palpable thrill (becauseresistance is always lower in the vein than in the artery during systole and diastole).\\nNeck veins: The neck veins are examined to estimate venous wave height and waveform. Height isproportional to right atrial pressure, and waveform reflects events in the cardiac cycle; both are bestobserved in the internal jugular vein.\\nThe jugular veins are usually examined with the patient reclining at 45°. The top of the venous column isnormally just below the clavicles (upper limit of normal: 4 cm above the sternal notch in a vertical plane).The venous column is elevated in heart failure, volume overload, cardiac tamponade, constrictivepericarditis, tricuspid stenosis, superior vena cava obstruction, or reduced compliance of the RV. If suchconditions are severe, the venous column can extend to jaw level, and its top can be detected only whenthe patient sits upright or stands. The venous column is low in hypovolemia.\\nNormally, the venous column can be briefly elevated by firm hand pressure on the abdomen(hepatojugular or abdominojugular reflux); the column falls back in a few seconds (maximum 3 respiratorycycles or 15 sec) despite continued abdominal pressure (because a compliant RV increases its strokevolume via the Frank-Starling mechanism). However, the column remains elevated (> 3 cm) duringabdominal pressure in disorders that cause a dilated and poorly compliant RV or in obstruction of RVfilling by tricuspid stenosis or right atrial tumor.\\nNormally, the venous column falls slightly during inspiration as lowered intrathoracic pressure draws bloodfrom the periphery into the vena cava. A rise in the venous column during inspiration (Kussmaul's sign)occurs typically in chronic constrictive pericarditis, right ventricular MI, and COPD, and usually in heartfailure and tricuspid stenosis.\\nJugular vein waves (seeFig. 206-1) can usually be discerned clinically but are better seen on the screen during central venouspressure monitoring.\\n[Fig. 206-1. Normal jugular vein waves.]\\nThe a waves are increased in pulmonary hypertension and tricuspid valve stenosis. Giant a waves(Cannon waves) are seen in atrioventricular dissociation when the atrium contracts while the tricuspidvalve is closed. The a waves disappear in atrial fibrillation and are accentuated when RV compliance ispoor (eg, in pulmonary hypertension or pulmonic stenosis). The v waves are very prominent in tricuspidregurgitation. The x descent is steep in cardiac tamponade. When RV compliance is poor, the y descentis very abrupt because the elevated column of venous blood rushes into the RV when the tricuspid valveopens, only to be stopped abruptly by the rigid RV wall (in restrictive myopathy) or the pericardium (inconstrictive pericarditis).\\nChest Inspection and Palpation\\nChest contour and any visible cardiac impulses are inspected. The precordium is palpated for pulsations(determining apical impulse and thus cardiac situs) and thrills.\\nInspection: Chest deformities, such as shield chest and pectus carinatum (a prominent birdlike sternum),may be associated with hereditary disorders involving congenital cardiac defects (eg, Turner's syndrome).Rarely, a localized upper chest bulge indicates aortic aneurysm due to syphilis. Pectus excavatum(depressed sternum) with a narrow anteroposterior chest diameter and an abnormally straight thoracicspine may suggest myxomatous degeneration of valves or chordae (particularly mitral) or Marfansyndrome.\\nPalpation: A central precordial heave is a palpable lifting sensation under the sternum and anterior chestwall to the left of the sternum; it suggests severe RV hypertrophy (RVH).

Abnormal focal systolic impulses in the precordium cansometimes be felt in patients with a dyskinetic ventricular aneurysm. An abnormal diffuse systolic impulselifts the precordium in patients with severe mitral regurgitation. The lift occurs because the left atriumexpands, causing anterior cardiac displacement. A diffuse and inferolaterally displaced apical impulse isfound when the LV is dilated and hypertrophied (eg, in mitral regurgitation).\\nLocation of thrills (palpable buzzing sensation present with particularly loud murmurs) suggests the cause(seeTable 206-2).\\nA sharp impulse at the 2nd intercostal space to the left of the sternum may result from exaggeratedpulmonic valve closure in pulmonary hypertension. A similar early systolic impulse at the cardiac apexmay represent closure of a stenotic mitral valve; opening of the stenotic valve sometimes can be felt atthe beginning of diastole. These findings coincide with an augmented 1st heart sound and an openingsnap of mitral stenosis, heard on auscultation.\\nCardiac Auscultation\\nAuscultation of the heart requires excellent hearing and the ability to distinguish subtle\\n[Table 206-2. Location of Thrills and Associated Disorders]\\ndifferences in pitch and timing. Hearing-impaired health care practitioners can use amplifiedstethoscopes. High-pitched sounds are best heard with the diaphragm of the stethoscope. Low-pitchedsounds are best heard with the bell. Very little pressure should be exerted when using the bell. Excessivepressure converts the underlying skin into a diaphragm and eliminates very low-pitched sounds.\\nThe entire precordium is examined systematically, typically beginning over the apical impulse with thepatient in the left lateral decubitus position. The patient rolls supine, and auscultation continues at thelower left sternal border, proceeds cephalad with auscultation of each interspace, then caudad from theright upper sternal border. The clinician also listens over the left axilla and above the clavicles. Thepatient sits upright for auscultation of the back, then leans forward to aid auscultation of aortic andpulmonic diastolic murmurs or pericardial friction rub.\\nMajor auscultatory findings include\\n• Heart sounds\\n• Murmurs\\n• Rubs\\nHeart sounds are brief, transient sounds produced by valve opening and closure; they are divided intosystolic and diastolic sounds.\\nMurmurs are produced by blood flow turbulence and are more prolonged than heart sounds; they maybe systolic, diastolic, or continuous. They are graded by intensity (seeTable 206-3) and are described by their location and when they occur within the cardiac cycle.\\nRubs are high-pitched, scratchy sounds often with 2 or 3 separate components; during tachycardia, thesound may be almost continuous.\\nThe clinician focuses attention sequentially on each phase of the cardiac cycle, noting each heart soundand murmur. Intensity, pitch, duration, and timing of the sounds and the intervals between them areanalyzed, often providing an accurate diagnosis.

Heart Murmur Intensity]\\nS1 and the 2nd heart sound (S2, a diastolic heart sound) are normal components of the cardiac cycle, thefamiliar \"lub-dub\" sounds.\\nS1 occurs just after the beginning of systole and is predominantly due to mitral closure but may alsoinclude tricuspid closure components. It is often split and has a high pitch. S1 is loud in mitral stenosis. Itmay be soft or absent in mitral regurgitation due to valve leaflet sclerosis and rigidity but is often distinctlyheard in mitral regurgitation due to myxomatous degeneration of the mitral apparatus or due to ventricularmyocardial abnormality (eg, papillary muscle dysfunction, ventricular dilation).\\nClicks occur only during systole; they are distinguished from S1 and S2 by their higher pitch and brieferduration. Some clicks occur at different times during systole as hemodynamics change. Clicks may besingle or multiple.\\nClicks in congenital aortic or pulmonic stenosis are thought to result from abnormal ventricular walltension. These clicks occur early in systole (very near S1) and are not affected by hemodynamicchanges. Similar clicks occur in severe pulmonary hypertension. Clicks in mitral or tricuspid valveprolapse, typically occurring in mid to late systole, are thought to result from abnormal tension onredundant and elongated chordae tendineae or valve leaflets.\\nClicks due to myxomatous degeneration of valves may occur any time during systole but move toward S1during maneuvers that transiently decrease ventricular filling volume (eg, standing, Valsalva maneuver). Ifventricular filling volume is increased (eg, by lying supine), clicks move toward S2, particularly in mitralvalve prolapse. For unknown reasons, characteristics of the clicks may vary greatly betweenexaminations, and clicks may come and go.\\n[Fig. 206-2.

Except for S2, these sounds are always abnormal in adults.\\nS2 occurs at the beginning of diastole, due to aortic and pulmonic valve closure. Aortic valve closurenormally precedes pulmonic valve closure unless the former is late or the latter is early. Aortic valveclosure is late in left bundle branch block or aortic stenosis; pulmonic valve closure is early in some formsof preexcitation phenomena. Delayed pulmonic valve closure may result from increased blood flowthrough the RV (eg, in atrial septal defect of the common secundum variety) or complete right bundlebranch block.

Left-to-right shunts with normal RV volumeflow (eg, in membranous ventricular septal defects) do not cause fixed splitting. A single S2 may occurwhen the aortic valve is regurgitant, severely stenotic, or atretic (in truncus arteriosus when there is acommon valve).\\nS3 occurs in early diastole, when the ventricle is dilated and noncompliant. It occurs during passivediastolic ventricular filling and indicates serious ventricular dysfunction in adults; in children, it can benormal. RV S3 is heard best (sometimes only) during inspiration (because negative intrathoracic pressureaugments RV filling volume) with the patient supine. LV S3 is best heard during expiration (because theheart is nearer the chest wall) with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position.\\nS4 is produced by augmented ventricular filling, caused by atrial contraction, near the end of diastole. It issimilar to S3 and heard best or only with the bell of the stethoscope. During inspiration, RV S4 increasesand LV S4 decreases. S4 is heard much more often than S3 and indicates a lesser degree of ventriculardysfunction, usually diastolic. S4 is absent in atrial fibrillation (because the atria do not contract) but isalmost always present in active myocardial ischemia or soon after MI. S3, with or without S4, is usual insignificant systolic LV dysfunction; S4 without S3 is usual in diastolic LV dysfunction.\\nA summation gallop occurs when S3 and S4 are present in a patient with tachycardia, which shortensdiastole so that the 2 sounds merge. Loud S3 and S4 may be palpable at the apex when the patient is inthe left lateral decubitus position.\\nA diastolic knock occurs at the same time as S3, in early diastole. It is not accompanied by S4 and is alouder, thudding sound, which indicates abrupt arrest of ventricular filling by a noncompliant, constrictingpericardium.\\nAn opening snap may occur in early diastole in mitral stenosis or, rarely, in tricuspid stenosis. Mitralopening snap is very high pitched, brief, and heard best with the diaphragm of the stethoscope. The moresevere mitral stenosis is (ie, the higher the left atrial pressure), the closer the opening snap is to thepulmonic component of S2. Intensity is related to the compliance of the valve leaflets: The snap soundsloud when leaflets remain elastic, but it gradually softens and ultimately disappears as sclerosis, fibrosis,and calcification of the valve develop. Mitral opening snap, although sometimes heard at the apex, isoften heard best or only at the lower left sternal border.\\n[Table 206-4. Etiology of Murmurs by Timing]\\nApproach to murmurs: Timing of the murmur in the cardiac cycle correlates with the cause (see Table206-4); auscultatory findings correlate with specific heart valve disorders. Various maneuvers (eg,inspiration, Valsalva, handgrip, squatting, amyl nitrate inhalation) can modify cardiac physiology slightly,making differentiation of causes of heart murmur possible (seeTable 206-5).\\nAll patients with heart murmurs are evaluated by chest x-ray and ECG. Most require echocardiography toconfirm the diagnosis, determine severity, and track severity over time. Usually, a cardiac consultation isobtained if significant disease is suspected.\\nSystolic murmurs: Systolic murmurs may be normal or abnormal. They may be early, mid, or latesystolic, or holosystolic (pansystolic). Systolic murmurs may be divided into ejection, regurgitant, andshunt murmurs.\\nEjection murmurs are due to turbulent forward flow through narrowed or irregular valves or outflowtracts (eg, due to aortic or pulmonic stenosis). They are typically mid systolic and have a crescendo-diminuendo character that usually becomes louder and longer as flow becomes more obstructed. Thegreater the stenosis and turbulence, the longer the crescendo phase and the shorter the diminuendo\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 206.

In normal infants\\n[Table 206-5. Maneuvers that Aid in Diagnosis of Murmurs]\\nand children, flow is often mildly turbulent, producing soft ejection murmurs. The elderly often haveejection murmurs due to valve and vessel sclerosis.\\nDuring pregnancy, many women have soft ejection murmurs at the 2nd intercostal space to the left or rightof the sternum. The murmurs occur because a physiologic increase in blood volume and cardiac outputincreases flow velocity through normal structures. The murmurs may be greatly exaggerated if severeanemia complicates the pregnancy.\\nRegurgitant murmurs represent retrograde or abnormal flow (eg, due to mitral regurgitation, tricuspidregurgitation, or ventricular septal defects) into chambers that are at lower resistance. They are typicallyholosystolic and tend to be louder with high-velocity, low-volume regurgitation or shunts and softer withhigh-volume regurgitation or shunts. Late systolic murmurs, which may or may not be preceded by a click,are typical of mitral valve prolapse or papillary muscle dysfunction. Various maneuvers are usuallyrequired for more accurate diagnosis of timing and type of murmur (see Table 206-5).\\nShunt murmurs may originate at the site of the shunt (eg, patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septaldefects) or result from altered hemodynamics remote from the shunt (eg, pulmonic systolic flow murmurdue to an atrial septal defect with left-to-right shunt).\\nDiastolic murmurs: Diastolic murmurs are always abnormal; most are early or mid diastolic, but theymay be late diastolic (presystolic). Early diastolic murmurs are typically due to aortic or pulmonicregurgitation. Mid diastolic (or early to mid diastolic) murmurs are typically due to mitral or tricuspidstenosis. A late diastolic murmur may be due to rheumatic mitral stenosis in a patient in sinus rhythm.\\nA mitral or tricuspid murmur due to an atrial tumor or thrombus may be evanescent and may vary withposition and from one examination to the next because the position of the intracardiac mass changes.\\nContinuous murmurs: Continuous murmurs occur throughout the cardiac cycle. They are alwaysabnormal, indicating a constant shunt flow throughout systole and diastole. They may be due to variouscardiac defects (see Table 206-4). Some defects produce a thrill; many are associated with signs of RVHand LVH. As pulmonary artery resistance increases in shunt lesions, the diastolic component graduallydecreases. When pulmonary and systemic resistance equalize, the murmur may disappear.\\nPatent ductus arteriosus murmurs are loudest at the 2nd intercostal space just below the medial end ofthe left clavicle. Aorticopulmonary window murmurs are central and heard at the 3rd intercostal spacelevel. Murmurs of systemic arteriovenous fistulas are best heard directly over the lesions; those ofpulmonic arteriovenous fistulas and pulmonary artery branch stenosis are more diffuse and heardthroughout the chest.\\nDuring pregnancy, a continuous venous hum from breast vessels (mammary souffle) may be mistaken fora continuous cardiac murmur.\\nPericardial friction rub: A pericardial friction rub is caused by movement of inflammatory adhesionsbetween visceral and parietal pericardial layers. It is a high-pitched or squeaking sound; it may besystolic, diastolic and systolic, or triphasic (when atrial contraction accentuates the diastolic componentduring late diastole). The rub sounds like pieces of leather squeaking as they are rubbed together. Rubsare best heard with the patient leaning forward or on hands and knees with breath held in expiration.\\nExtremity and Abdominal Examination\\nThe extremities and abdomen are examined for signs of fluid overload, which may occur with heart failure\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 206.

Edema may be visible on inspection, butmodest amounts of edema in very obese or muscular people may be difficult to recognize visually. Thus,extremities are palpated for presence and degree of pitting (visible and palpable depressions caused bypressure from the examiner\\'s fingers, which displaces the interstitial fluid). The area of edema isexamined for extent, symmetry (ie, comparing both extremities), warmth, erythema, and tenderness. Withsignificant fluid overload, edema may also be present over the sacrum, genitals, or both.\\nTenderness, erythema, or both, particularly when unilateral, suggests an inflammatory cause (eg, cellulitisor thrombophlebitis). Nonpitting edema is more suggestive of lymphatic or vascular obstruction than fluidoverload.\\nAbdomen: In the abdomen, significant fluid overload manifests as ascites (see p.206). Marked ascites causes visible abdominal distention, which is tense and nontender to palpation, withshifting dullness on abdominal percussion and a fluid wave. The liver may be distended and slightlytender, with a hepatojugular reflux (see p. 2019) present.\\nChest Pain\\nChest pain is a very common complaint. Many patients are well aware that it is a warning of potential life-threatening disorders and seek evaluation for minimal symptoms. Other patients, including many withserious disease, minimize or ignore its warnings. Pain perception (both character and severity) variesgreatly between individuals as well as between men and women. However described, chest pain shouldnever be dismissed without an explanation of its cause.\\nPathophysiology\\nThe heart, lungs, esophagus, and great vessels provide afferent visceral input through the same thoracicautonomic ganglia. A painful stimulus in these organs is typically perceived as originating in the chest, butbecause afferent nerve fibers overlap in the dorsal ganglia, thoracic pain may be felt (as referred pain)anywhere between the umbilicus and the ear, including the upper extremities.\\nPainful stimuli from thoracic organs can cause discomfort described as pressure, tearing, gas with theurge to eructate, indigestion, burning, aching, stabbing, and sometimes sharp needle-like pain. When thesensation is visceral in origin, many patients deny they are having pain and insist it is merely \"discomfort.\"\\nEtiology\\nMany disorders cause chest pain or discomfort. These disorders may involve the cardiovascular, GI,pulmonary, neurologic, or musculoskeletal systems (seeTable 206-6).\\nSome disorders are immediately life threatening:\\n• Acute coronary syndromes (acute MI/unstable angina)\\n• Thoracic aortic dissection\\n• Tension pneumothorax\\n• Esophageal rupture\\n• Pulmonary embolism (PE)\\nOther causes range from serious, potential threats to life to causes that are simply uncomfortable.

The abdomen is palpated for tenderness, organomegaly,and masses or tenderness, particularly in the epigastric and right upper quadrant regions.\\nThe legs are examined for arterial pulses, adequacy of perfusion, edema, varicose veins, and signs ofDVT (eg, swelling, erythema, and tenderness).\\nRed flags: Certain findings raise suspicion of a more serious etiology of chest pain:\\n• Abnormal vital signs (tachycardia, bradycardia, tachypnea, hypotension)\\n• Signs of hypoperfusion (eg, confusion, ashen color, diaphoresis)\\n• Shortness of breath\\n• Asymmetric breath sounds or pulses\\n• New heart murmurs\\n• Pulsus paradoxus > 10 mm Hg\\nInterpretation of findings: Symptoms and signs of thoracic disorders vary greatly, and those of seriousand nonserious conditions often overlap. Although red flag findings indicate a high likelihood of seriousdisease, and many disorders have \"classic\" manifestations (see Table 206-6), many patients who haveserious illness do not present with these classic symptoms and signs. For example, patients withmyocardial ischemia may complain only of indigestion or have a very tender chest wall on palpation. Ahigh index of suspicion is important when evaluating patients with chest pain. Nonetheless, somedistinctions and generalizations are possible.\\nDuration of pain can provide clues to the severity of the disorder. Long-standing pain (ie, for weeks ormonths) is not a manifestation of a disorder that is immediately life threatening. Such pain is oftenmusculoskeletal in origin, although GI origin or a cancer should be considered, particularly in patients whoare elderly. Similarly, brief (< 5 sec), sharp, intermittent pains rarely result from serious disorders. Seriousdisorders typically manifest pain lasting minutes to hours, although episodes may be recurrent (eg,unstable angina may cause several bouts of pain over 1 or more days).\\nPatient age is helpful in evaluating chest pain. Chest pain in children and young adults (< 30 yr) is lesslikely to result from myocardial ischemia, although MI can occur in people in their 20s. Musculoskeletaland pulmonary disorders are more common causes in these age groups.\\nExacerbation and relief of symptoms also are helpful in evaluating chest pain. Although angina can befelt anywhere between the ear and the umbilicus (and often not in the chest), it is typically consistentlyrelated to physical or emotional stress, ie, patients do not experience angina from climbing one flight ofstairs one day and tolerate 3 flights the next day. Nocturnal angina is characteristic of heart failure orcoronary artery spasm.\\nPain from many disorders, both serious and minor, can be exacerbated by respiration, movement, orpalpation of the chest. These findings are not specific for origin in the chest wall; about 15% of patientswith acute MI have chest tenderness on palpation.\\nNitroglycerin may relieve pain of both myocardial ischemia and noncardiac smooth muscle spasm (eg,esophageal or biliary disorders); its efficacy or lack thereof should not be used for diagnosis.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 206.

Fever is nonspecific but, if accompanied by cough,suggests a pulmonary cause. Patients with Raynaud\\'s syndrome or migraine headaches sometimes havecoronary spasm.\\nThe presence or absence of risk factors for CAD (eg, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking,obesity, diabetes, positive family history) alters the probability of underlying CAD but does not helpdiagnose the cause of a given episode of acute chest pain. Patients with those factors may well haveanother cause of chest pain, and patients without them may have an acute coronary syndrome. However,known CAD in a patient with chest pain raises the likelihood of that diagnosis as the cause (particularly ifthe patient describes the symptoms as \"like my angina\" or \"like my last heart attack\").\\nTesting: For adults with acute chest pain, immediate life threats must be ruled out. Most patients shouldinitially have pulse oximetry, ECG, and chest x-ray. If symptoms suggest an acute coronary syndrome or ifno other cause is clear (particularly in at-risk patients), troponin and CK levels are measured. If a PE isconsidered possible, D-dimer testing is done. Expeditious evaluation is essential because if MI or otheracute coronary syndrome is present, the patient should be sent immediately to the heart catheterizationlaboratory (when available); the therapeutic window for primary percutaneous coronary intervention is 90min and that for thrombolysis is only slightly longer.\\nSome abnormal findings on these tests confirm a diagnosis (eg, acute MI, pneumothorax, pneumonia).Other abnormalities suggest a diagnosis or at least the need to pursue further investigation (eg, abnormalaortic contour suggests need for testing for thoracic aortic dissection). Thus, if these initial test results arenormal, thoracic aortic dissection, tension pneumothorax, and esophageal rupture are highly unlikely.However, in acute coronary syndromes, ECG may not change for several hours or sometimes not at all,and in PE, oxygenation may be normal. Thus, other studies may need to be obtained based on findingsfrom the history and physical examination (see Table 206-6).\\nBecause a single normal set of cardiac markers does not rule out a cardiac cause, patients whosesymptoms suggest an acute coronary syndrome should have serial measurement of cardiac markers(troponin and CK-MB fraction) and ECGs. Some clinicians follow these tests (acutely or within severaldays) with a stress ECG or a stress imaging test. Drug treatment is begun while awaiting results from the2nd set of markers unless there is a clear contraindication. A diagnostic trial of sublingual nitroglycerin oran oral liquid antacid does not adequately differentiate myocardial ischemia from gastroesophageal refluxdisease or gastritis. Either drug may relieve symptoms of either disorder. Troponin will be elevated in allacute coronary syndromes except new-onset angina and often in other disorders that damage themyocardium (eg, myocarditis, pericarditis, aortic dissection involving coronary artery flow, PE, heartfailure, severe sepsis). CK may be elevated from damage to any muscle tissue, but CK-MB elevation isspecific to damage to the myocardium. ST-segment abnormality on the ECG may be nonspecific or due toantecedent disorders, so comparison with previous ECGs is important.\\nThe likelihood of PE is affected by a number of factors (seeTable 194-2 on p. 1912), which can be used in an algorithm to derive an approach to testing.\\nIn patients with chronic chest pain, immediate threats to life are unlikely. Most clinicians initially obtain achest x-ray and do other tests based on symptoms and signs.\\nTreatment\\nSpecific identified disorders are treated. If etiology is not clearly benign, patients are usually admitted tothe hospital or an observation unit for cardiac monitoring and more extensive evaluation. Symptoms aretreated with acetaminophen or opioids as needed (see p. 1623), pending a diagnosis. Pain relief followingopioid treatment should not diminish the urgency of ruling out serious and life-threatening disease.\\nGeriatrics Essentials\\nThe probability of serious and life-threatening disease increases with age.

The fluid is predominantly water, butprotein and cell-rich fluid can accumulate if there is infection or lymphatic obstruction.\\nEdema may be generalized or local (eg, limited to a single extremity or part of an extremity). It sometimesappears abruptly; patients complain that an extremity suddenly swells. More often, edema developsinsidiously, beginning with weight gain, puffy eyes at awakening in the morning, and tight shoes at theend of the day. Slowly developing edema may become massive before patients seek medical care.\\nEdema itself causes few symptoms other than occasionally a feeling of tightness or fullness; othersymptoms are usually related to the underlying disorder. Patients with edema due to heart failure (acommon cause) often have dyspnea during exertion, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.Patients with edema due to deep venous thrombosis (DVT) often have pain.\\nEdema due to extracellular fluid volume expansion is often dependent. Thus, in ambulatory patients,edema is in the feet and lower legs; patients requiring bed rest develop edema in the buttocks, genitals,and posterior thighs. Women who lie on only one side may develop edema in the dependent breast.Lymphatic obstruction causes edema distal to the site of obstruction.\\nPathophysiology\\nEdema results from increased movement of fluid from the intravascular to the interstitial space ordecreased movement of water from the interstitium into the capillaries or lymphatic vessels. Themechanism involves one or more of the following:\\n• Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure\\n• Decreased plasma oncotic pressure\\n• Increased capillary permeability\\n• Obstruction of the lymphatic system\\nAs fluid shifts into the interstitial space, intravascular volume is depleted. Intravascular volume depletionactivates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-ADH system, resulting in renal Na retention. By increasingosmolality, renal Na retention triggers water retention by the kidneys and helps maintain plasma volume.Increased renal Na retention also may be a primary cause of fluid overload and hence edema.

Patients with heart failure shouldeliminate salt in cooking and at the table and avoid prepared foods with added salt. Patients withadvanced cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome often require more severe Na restriction (≤ 1 g/day). K saltsare often substituted for Na salts to make Na restriction tolerable; however, care should be taken,especially in patients receiving K-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers and inthose with a kidney disorder because potentially fatal hyperkalemia can result.\\nPeople with conditions involving Na retention may also benefit from loop or thiazide diuretics. However,diuretics should not be prescribed only to improve the appearance caused by edema. When diuretics areused, K wasting can be dangerous in some patients; K-sparing diuretics (eg, amiloride, triamterene,spironolactone, eplerenone) inhibit Na reabsorption in the distal nephron and collecting duct. When usedalone, they modestly increase Na excretion. Both triamterene and amiloride have been combined with athiazide to prevent K wasting. An ACE inhibitor-thiazide combination also reduces K wasting.\\nGeriatrics Essentials\\nIn the elderly, use of drugs that treat causes of edema requires special caution, such as the following:\\n• Starting doses low and evaluating patients thoroughly when the dose is changed\\n• Monitoring for orthostatic hypotension if diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or β-blockers are used\\n• Evaluating for bradycardia or heart block if digoxin, rate-limiting Ca channel blockers, or β-blockers areused\\n• Frequently testing for hypokalemia or hyperkalemia\\n• Not stopping Ca channel blockers because of pedal edema, which is benign\\nLogging daily weight helps in monitoring clinical improvement or deterioration immensely.\\nKey Points\\n• Edema may result from a generalized or local process.\\n• Main causes of generalized edema are chronic heart, liver, and kidney disorders.\\n• Sudden onset should trigger prompt evaluation.\\n• Edema may occur anywhere in the body, including the brain.\\n• Not all edema is harmful; consequences depend mainly on the cause.\\nOrthostatic Hypotension\\nOrthostatic (postural) hypotension is an excessive fall in BP when an upright position is assumed. Theconsensus definition is a drop of > 20 mm Hg systolic, 10 mm Hg diastolic, or both. Symptoms offaintness, light-headedness, dizziness, confusion, or blurred vision occur within seconds to a few minutesof standing and resolve rapidly on lying down. Some patients experience falls, syncope (see p. 2041), oreven generalized seizures. Exercise or a heavy meal may exacerbate symptoms. Most other associatedsymptoms and signs relate to the cause. Orthostatic hypotension is a manifestation of abnormal BPregulation due to various conditions, not a specific disorder.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 206.

Various symptoms (eg, fatigue, light-headedness, exercise intolerance, cognitiveimpairment) and tachycardia occur with standing; however, there is little or no fall in BP. The reason forsymptoms is unclear.\\nPathophysiology\\nNormally, the gravitational stress of suddenly standing causes blood (1/2 to 1 L) to pool in thecapacitance veins of the legs and trunk. The subsequent transient decrease in venous return reducescardiac output and thus BP. In response, baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid bodies activateautonomic reflexes to rapidly return BP to normal. The sympathetic system increases heart rate andcontractility and increases vasomotor tone of the capacitance vessels. Simultaneous parasympathetic(vagal) inhibition also increases heart rate. In most people, changes in BP and heart rate with standingare minimal and transient, and symptoms do not occur.\\nWith continued standing, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and ADH secretioncause Na and water retention and increase circulating blood volume.\\nEtiology\\nHomeostatic mechanisms may be inadequate to restore low BP if afferent, central, or efferent portions ofthe autonomic reflex arc are impaired by disorders or drugs, if myocardial contractility or vascularresponsiveness is depressed, if hypovolemia is present, or if hormonal responses are faulty (seeTable 206-8).\\nCauses differ depending on whether symptoms are acute or chronic.\\nThe most common causes of acute orthostatic hypotension include\\n• Hypovolemia\\n• Drugs\\n• Prolonged bed rest\\n• Adrenal insufficiency\\nThe most common causes of chronic orthostatic hypotension include\\n• Age-related changes in BP regulation\\n• Drugs\\n• Autonomic dysfunction\\nPostprandial orthostatic hypotension is also common. It may be caused by the insulin response to high-carbohydrate meals and blood pooling in the GI tract; this condition is worsened by alcohol intake.\\nEvaluation\\nOrthostatic hypotension is diagnosed when a marked fall in measured BP and symptoms suggestinghypotension are provoked by standing and relieved by lying down.

Other symptoms of neurologic and cardiovascular disorders and cancer are noted.\\n[Table 206-8. Causes of Orthostatic Hypotension]\\nPast medical history should identify known potential causes, including diabetes, Parkinson's disease,and cancer (ie, causing a paraneoplastic syndrome). The drug profile should be reviewed for offendingprescription drugs (see Table 206-8) particularly antihypertensives and nitrates. A family history oforthostatic symptoms suggests possible familial dysautonomia.\\nPhysical examination: BP and heart rate are measured after 5 min supine and at 1 and 3 min afterstanding; patients unable to stand may be assessed while sitting upright. Hypotension without acompensatory increase in heart rate (< 10 beats/min) suggests autonomic impairment. Marked increase(to > 100 beats/min or by > 30 beats/min) suggests hypovolemia or, if symptoms develop withouthypotension, POTS.\\nThe skin and mucosae are inspected for signs of dehydration and for pigment changes suggestive ofAddison's disease (eg, hyperpigmented areas, vitiligo). A rectal examination is done to detect GI bleeding.\\nDuring the neurologic examination, GU and rectal reflexes are tested to evaluate autonomic function;assessment includes the cremasteric reflex (normally, stroking the thigh results in retraction of the testes),anal wink reflex (normally, stroking perianal skin results in contraction of the anal sphincter), andbulbocavernosus reflex (normally, squeezing the glans penis or clitoris results in contraction of the analsphincter). Signs of peripheral neuropathy (eg, abnormalities of strength, sensation, and deep tendonreflexes) are assessed.\\nRed flags: Certain findings suggest a more serious etiology:\\n• Bloody or heme-positive stool\\n• Abnormal neurologic examination\\nInterpretation of findings: In patients with acute symptoms, the most common causes—drugs, bed rest,and volume depletion—are often apparent clinically.\\nIn patients with chronic symptoms, an important goal is to detect any neurologic disorder causingautonomic dysfunction. Patients with movement abnormalities may have Parkinson's disease or multiplesystem atrophy. Patients with findings of peripheral neuropathy may have an apparent cause (eg,diabetes, alcoholism), but a paraneoplastic syndrome due to an occult cancer and amyloidosis must beconsidered. Patients who have only peripheral autonomic symptoms may have pure autonomic failure.\\nTesting: ECG and serum electrolytes and glucose are routinely checked. However, these and other testsare usually of little benefit unless suggested by specific symptoms.\\nAutonomic function can be evaluated with bedside cardiac monitoring. When the autonomic system isintact, heart rate increases in response to inspiration. The heart is monitored as the patient breathesslowly and deeply (about a 5-sec inspiration and a 7-sec expiration) for 1 min. The longest interbeat (R-R)interval during expiration is normally at least 1.15 times the minimum R-R interval during inspiration; ashorter interval suggests autonomic dysfunction. A similar variation in R-R interval should exist betweenrest and a 10- to 15-sec Valsalva maneuver. Patients with abnormal R-R intervals or with autonomicsymptoms or signs require further evaluation for diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and possibly multiplesystem atrophy (see p. 1618) and pure autonomic failure (see p. 1619); the last may require plasmanorepinephrine or ADH (vasopressin) measurements with the patient supine and upright.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 206.

The patient may remain upright for 30 to 45 min of BP assessment.\\nTreatment\\nPatients requiring prolonged bed rest should sit up each day and exercise in bed when possible. Patientsshould rise slowly from a recumbent or sitting position, consume adequate fluids, limit or avoid alcohol,and exercise regularly when feasible. Regular modest-intensity exercise promotes overall vascular toneand reduces venous pooling. Elderly patients should avoid prolonged standing. Sleeping with the head ofthe bed raised may relieve symptoms by promoting Na retention and reducing nocturnal diuresis.\\nPostprandial hypotension can often be prevented by reducing the size and carbohydrate content ofmeals, minimizing alcohol intake, and avoiding sudden standing after meals.\\nWaist-high fitted elastic hose may increase venous return, cardiac output, and BP after standing. Insevere cases, inflatable aviator-type antigravity suits, although often poorly tolerated, may be needed toproduce adequate leg and abdominal counterpressure.\\nIncreasing Na intake may expand intravascular volume and lessen symptoms. In the absence of heartfailure or hypertension, Na intake can be increased 5 to 10 g above the usual dietary level by liberallysalting food or taking NaCl tablets. This approach risks heart failure, particularly in elderly patients andpatients with impaired myocardial function; development of dependent edema without heart failure doesnot contraindicate continuing this approach.\\nFludrocortisone, a mineralocorticoid, causes Na retention, which expands plasma volume, and oftenlessens symptoms but is effective only when Na intake is adequate. Dosage is 0.1 mg po at bedtime,increased weekly to 1 mg or until peripheral edema occurs. This drug may also improve the peripheralvasoconstrictor response to sympathetic stimulation. Supine hypertension, heart failure, and hypokalemiamay occur; K supplements may be needed.\\nMidodrine, a peripheral α-agonist that is both an arterial and venous constrictor, is often effective. Dosageis 2.5 mg to 10 mg po tid. Adverse effects include paresthesias and itching (probably secondary topiloerection). This drug is not recommended for patients with coronary artery or peripheral arterialdisease.\\nNSAIDs (eg, indomethacin 25 to 50 mg po tid) may inhibit prostaglandin-induced vasodilation, increasingperipheral vascular resistance. However, NSAIDs may cause GI symptoms and unwanted vasopressorreactions (reported with concurrent use of indomethacin and sympathomimetic drugs).\\nL-Dihydroxyphenylserine, a norepinephrine precursor, may be beneficial for autonomic dysfunction(reported in limited trials).\\nPropranolol or other β-blockers may enhance the beneficial effects of Na and mineralocorticoid therapy. β-Blockade with propranolol leads to unopposed α-adrenergic peripheral vascular vasoconstriction,preventing the vasodilation that occurs when some patients stand.\\nGeriatrics Essentials\\nOrthostatic hypotension occurs in about 20% of the elderly; it is more common among people withcoexisting disorders, especially hypertension, and among residents of long-term care facilities.

They are often described as a fluttering, racing, orskipping sensation. They are common; some patients find them unpleasant and alarming. Palpitations canoccur in the absence of heart disease or can result from life-threatening heart disorders. The key todiagnosis and treatment is to \"capture\" the rhythm on ECG and make careful observations during thepalpitations.\\nPathophysiology\\nThe mechanisms responsible for the sensation of palpitations are unknown. Ordinarily, sinus rhythm at anormal rate is not perceived, and palpitations thus usually reflect changes in cardiac rate, rhythm, orcontractility. In all cases, it is the abnormal movement of the heart within the chest that is felt. In cases ofisolated extrasystoles, the patient may actually perceive the augmented post-extrasystolic beat as the\"skipped\" beat rather than the premature beat itself, probably because the extrasystole blocks the nextsinus beat and allows longer ventricular filling and thus a higher stroke volume.\\nThe clinical perception of cardiac phenomena is highly variable. Some patients are aware of virtuallyevery premature ventricular beat, but others are unaware of even complex atrial or ventriculartachyarrhythmias. Awareness is heightened in sedentary, anxious, or depressed patients and reduced inactive, happy patients. In some cases, palpitations are perceived in the absence of any abnormal cardiacactivity.\\nEtiology\\nSome patients simply have heightened awareness of normal cardiac activity, particularly when exercise,febrile illness, or anxiety increases heart rate. However, in most cases, palpitations result from arrhythmia.Arrhythmias range from benign to life threatening.\\nThe most common arrhythmias include\\n• Premature atrial contractions (PACs)\\n• Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)\\nBoth of these arrhythmias usually are harmless.\\nOther common arrhythmias include\\n• Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)\\n• Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 206.

These tests are used mainly when a sustained arrhythmia is suspected, ratherthan when symptoms suggest only occasional skipped beats. Patients with very infrequent symptoms thatclinicians suspect represent a serious arrhythmia may have a device implanted beneath the skin of theupper chest.

All patients should have measurement of CBC, serumelectrolytes including Mg and Ca, and C-reactive protein (indicating inflammation that may be affectingthe heart or coronary arteries).

It is usually classifiedand discussed with syncope because the causes are the same.\\nSeizures can cause sudden LOC but are not considered syncope. However, seizures must beconsidered in patients presenting for apparent syncope because history may be unclear or unavailable,and some seizures do not cause tonic-clonic convulsions. Furthermore, a brief (< 5 sec) seizuresometimes occurs with true syncope.\\nDiagnosis depends on a careful history, eyewitness accounts, or fortuitous examination during the event.\\nPathophysiology\\nMost syncope results from insufficient cerebral blood flow.

Syncope involving these mechanisms (except for hemorrhage) is oftentermed vasovagal or neurocardiogenic and is common and benign.\\nOrthostatic hypotension, a common benign cause of syncope, results from failure of normal mechanisms(eg, sinus tachycardia, vasoconstriction, or both) to compensate for the temporary decrease in venousreturn that occurs with standing (see p. 2035).\\nCerebrovascular disorders (eg, strokes, transient ischemic attacks) rarely cause syncope becausemost of them do not involve the centrencephalic structures that must be affected to produce LOC.However, basilar artery ischemia, due to transient ischemic attack or migraine, may cause syncope.Rarely, patients with severe cervical arthritis or spondylosis develop vertebrobasilar insufficiency withsyncope when the head is moved in certain positions.\\nInsufficient cerebral substrate: The CNS requires O2 and glucose to function. Even with normalcerebral blood flow, a significant deficit of either will cause LOC. In practice, hypoglycemia is the primarycause because hypoxia rarely develops in a manner causing abrupt LOC (other than in flying or divingincidents). LOC due to hypoglycemia is seldom as abrupt as in syncope or seizures because warningsymptoms occur (except in patients taking β-blockers); however, the onset may be unclear to theexaminer unless the event was witnessed.\\nEtiology\\nCauses are usually classified by the mechanism (seeTable 206-11).\\nThe most common causes are\\n• Vasovagal\\n• Idiopathic\\nMany cases never have a firm diagnosis but lead to no apparent harm. A smaller number of cases have aserious cause, usually cardiac.\\nEvaluation\\nEvaluation should be done as soon as possible after the event. The more remote the syncopal event, themore difficult the diagnosis. Information from witnesses is quite helpful and best obtained as soon aspossible.\\nHistory: History of present illness should ascertain events leading up to the syncope, including thepatient's activity (eg, exercising, arguing, in a potentially emotional situation), position (eg, lying orstanding), and, if standing, for how long. Important associated symptoms immediately before or after theevent include whether there was a sense of impending LOC, nausea, sweating, blurred or tunnel vision,tingling of lips or fingertips, chest pain, or palpitations. Witnesses, if any, should be sought and asked todescribe events, particularly the presence and duration of any seizure activity.\\nReview of systems should ask about any areas of pain or injury, episodes of dizziness or near syncopeon arising, and episodes of palpitations or chest pain with exertion. Patients should be asked aboutsymptoms suggesting possible causes, including bloody or tarry stools, heavy menses (anemia); vomiting,diarrhea, or excess urination (dehydration or electrolyte abnormalities); and risk factors for pulmonaryembolism (recent surgery or immobilization, known cancer, previous clots or hypercoagulable state).\\nPast medical history should ask about previous syncopal events, known cardiovascular disease, andknown seizure disorders. Drugs used should be identified (particularly antihypertensives, diuretics,vasodilators, and antiarrhythmics—seeTable 206-12).

Cardiovascular Tests and Procedures\\nIntroduction\\nMany noninvasive and invasive tests can delineate cardiac structure and function (seeTable 207-1). Also, treatments can be administered during certain invasive diagnostic tests (eg,percutaneous coronary intervention during cardiac catheterization, radiofrequency ablation duringelectrophysiologic testing).\\nCardiac Catheterization\\nCardiac catheterization is the passage of a catheter through peripheral arteries or veins into cardiacchambers and coronary arteries. Cardiac catheterization can be used to do various tests, includingangiography, intravascular ultrasonography, measurement of cardiac output (CO), detection andquantification of shunts, endomyocardial biopsy, and measurements of myocardial metabolism. Thesetests define coronary artery anatomy, cardiac anatomy, and cardiac function to establish diagnoses andhelp select treatment. Cardiac catheterization is also the basis for several therapeutic interventions.\\nProcedure\\nPatients must be npo for 4 to 6 h before cardiac catheterization. Most patients do not require overnighthospitalization.\\nLeft heart catheterization is most commonly used to assess coronary artery anatomy; it is also usefulfor assessing aortic BP and systemic vascular resistance, aortic and mitral valve function, and leftventricular (LV) pressure and function. The procedure is done by percutaneous femoral, radial, or brachialartery puncture, with a catheter passed into the coronary artery ostia or across the aortic valve into theLV. Catheterization of the left atrium (LA) and LV is occasionally done using transseptal perforation duringright heart catheterization.\\nRight heart catheterization is most commonly used to assess right atrial (RA), right ventricular (RV),and pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP—seeFig. 207-1 and p.2245); PAOP approximates LA and LV end-diastolic pressure. In seriously ill patients, PAOP helps assessvolume status and, with simultaneous measurements of CO, can help guide therapy. Right heartcatheterization is also useful for assessing pulmonary vascular resistance, tricuspid\\n[Table 207-1. Tests for Assessing Cardiac Anatomy and Function]\\nor pulmonic valve function, and RV pressure; RV pressure may help in the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy,constrictive pericarditis, and cardiac tamponade when noninvasive testing is nondiagnostic. Theprocedure is done by femoral, subclavian, internal jugular, or antecubital vein puncture. A catheter ispassed into the RA, through the tricuspid valve, into the RV, and across the pulmonary valve into thepulmonary artery (see p. 2244). Selective catheterization of the coronary sinus can also be done.\\nSpecific Tests During Cardiac Catheterization\\nAngiography: Injection of radiopaque dye into coronary or pulmonary arteries, the aorta, and cardiacchambers is useful in certain circumstances. Digital subtraction angiography is used for nonmovingarteries and for chamber cineangiography.\\nCoronary angiography via left heart catheterization is used to evaluate coronary artery anatomy in variousclinical situations, as in patients with suspected coronary atherosclerotic or congenital disease, valvulardisorders before valvular replacement, or unexplained heart failure.\\nPulmonary angiography via right heart catheterization is used to diagnose pulmonary embolism.Intraluminal filling defects or arterial cutoffs are diagnostic. Radiopaque dye is usually selectively injectedinto one or both pulmonary arteries and their segments.

After LV mass and volume are determined from singleplanar or biplanar ventricular angiograms, end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes and ejection fractioncan be calculated.\\nIntravascular ultrasonography: Miniature ultrasound transducers on the end of coronary arterycatheters can produce images of coronary vessel lumina and walls and delineate blood flow. Thistechnique is being increasingly used at the same time as coronary angiography.\\nTests for cardiac shunts: Measuring blood O2 content at successive levels in the heart and greatvessels can help determine the presence, direction, and volume of central shunts. The maximal normaldifference in O2 content is 0.5 mL/dL between the pulmonary artery and RV, 0.9 mL/dL between the RVand RA, and 1.9 mL/dL between the RA and superior vena cava. If the blood O2 content in a chamberexceeds that of the more proximal chamber by more than these values, a left-to-right shunt at that level isprobable. Right-to-left shunts are strongly suspected when LA, LV, or arterial O2 saturation is low (≤ 92%)and does not improve when pure O2 (fractional\\n[Fig. 207-1. Diagram of the cardiac cycle, showing pressure curves of the cardiac chambers, heartsounds, jugular pulse wave, and the ECG.]\\ninspirational O2 = 1.0) is given. Left heart or arterial desaturation plus increased O2 content in bloodsamples drawn beyond the shunt site on the right side of circulation suggests a bidirectional shunt.\\nMeasurement of cardiac output and flow: CO is the volume of blood ejected by the heart per minute(normal at rest: 4 to 8 L/min). Techniques used to calculate CO include the Fick, indicator-dilution, andthermodilution techniques (seeTable 207-2).\\nWith the Fick technique, CO is proportional to O2 consumption divided by arteriovenous O2 difference.\\nDilution techniques rely on the assumption that after an indicator is injected into the circulation, it appearsand disappears proportionately to CO.\\nUsually, CO is expressed in relation to BSA as the cardiac index (CI) in L/min/m2 (ie, CI = CO/BSA—seeTable 207-3). BSA is calculated using DuBois' height (ht)-weight (wt) equation:\\nBSA in m2 = (wt in kg)0.425 × (ht in cm)0.725 × 0.007184\\nEndomyocardial biopsy: This procedure helps assess transplant rejection and myocardial disordersdue to infection or infiltrative diseases. The biopsy catheter (bioptome) can be passed into eitherventricle, usually the right. Three to 5 samples of myocardial tissue are removed from the septalendocardium. The main complication, cardiac perforation, occurs in 0.3 to 0.5% of patients; it may causehemopericardium leading to cardiac tamponade.\\nCoronary artery flow measurements: Coronary angiography shows the presence and degree ofstenosis but not the functional significance of the lesion (ie, how much blood flows across the stenosis).Extremely thin guidewires are available with pressure sensors or Doppler flow sensors. Data from thesesensors can be used to estimate blood flow, which is expressed as fractional flow reserve (FFR). FFR isthe ratio of maximal flow through the stenotic area to normal maximal flow; an FFR of < 0.75 to 0.8 isconsidered abnormal. These flow estimates correlate well with the need for intervention and long-termoutcome; lesions with good FFR do not seem to benefit from stenting.

Rarely, bradycardia occurs when a large amount of dye is injected; asking the patient tocough often restores normal rhythm. Patients with a high Hct are susceptible to thrombosis; the Hctshould be < 65% before angiography is done. Allergic reactions may include urticaria and conjunctivitis,which usually respond to diphenhydramine 50 mg IV. Bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, and dyspnea arerare reactions; they are treated with salbutamol or epinephrine. Anaphylactic shock is treated withepinephrine and other supportive measures. If the catheter tip contacts the ventricular endocardium,ventricular arrhythmias commonly occur, but ventricular fibrillation is rare. If it occurs, direct current (DC)cardioversion is administered immediately (see p. 2260). Radiopaque dyes, all hypertonic, are excretedby the kidneys and may worsen renal insufficiency. For patients at risk, infusion of normal saline IV, andperhaps premedication with acetylcysteine, reduces this risk.\\nMortality rate is 0.1 to 0.2%. MI (0.1%) and stroke (0.1%) may result in significant morbidity. Incidence ofstroke is higher in patients > 80 yr. Dissection of a coronary artery can complicate angiography. Localvascular injury at the peripheral insertion site of catheterization can cause hemorrhage or formation ofpseudoaneurysms or arteriovenous fistulas.\\nCoronary Artery Bypass Grafting\\nCoronary artery bypass grafting (CABG—see also p. 2098) involves bypassing native coronary arterieswith high-grade stenosis or occlusion not amenable to angioplasty with stenting. Indications are changingas percutaneous interventions (see p. 2059) are being increasingly used.\\nTraditional CABG Procedure\\nThe procedure involves thoracotomy via a midline (median) sternotomy. A heart-lung machine is used toestablish cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), allowing the heart to be stopped and emptied of blood tomaximize operative exposure and facilitate vessel anastomosis; stopping the heart also markedlydecreases myocardial O2 demand.

Then the aorta is cross-clamped and the heart is stoppedby injection of a cardioplegic solution (crystalloid or more commonly blood-based) that also containssubstances that help myocardial cells tolerate ischemia and reperfusion. The cardioplegic solution andthe heart are sometimes cooled slightly to enhance tolerance of ischemia; the patient's body is cooled viathe CPB machine for similar reasons.\\nThe left internal mammary artery is typically used as a pedicled graft to the left anterior descendingcoronary artery. Other grafts consist of segments of saphenous vein removed from the leg. Occasionally,the right internal mammary artery or radial artery from the non-dominant arm can be used.\\nOn completion of the vascular anastomoses, the aorta is unclamped, allowing the coronary arteries to beperfused by oxygenated blood, which typically restores cardiac activity. Heparin anticoagulation isreversed by giving protamine. Despite cardioprotective measures, stopping the heart is not withoutconsequences. During reperfusion, myocardial dysfunction is common and can lead to bradycardia,arrhythmias (eg, ventricular fibrillation), and low cardiac output; these events are treated by standardmeasures, such as pacing, defibrillation, and inotropic drugs.\\nTypically, hospital stays are 4 to 5 days unless prolonged by complications.\\nComplications: Complications and disadvantages of traditional CABG involve mainly\\n• Sternotomy\\n• CPB\\nMedian sternotomy is surprisingly well tolerated; however, healing takes 4 to 6 wk. Also, wound infectionsoccasionally cause mediastinitis or sternal osteomyelitis, which can be vexing to treat.\\nCPB causes several complications, including\\n• Bleeding\\n• Organ dysfunction\\n• Neuropsychiatric effects\\n• Stroke\\nPost-CPB bleeding is a common problem caused by various factors, including hemodilution, heparin use,platelet dysfunction due to exposure to the bypass pump, consumptive coagulopathy, and inducedhypothermia. Also, the CPB machine evokes a systemic inflammatory response (probably due to exposureof blood components to the foreign material of the bypass circuit); this response can cause organdysfunction in any system (eg, pulmonary, renal, brain, GI). Aortic cannulation, cross-clamping, andrelease can trigger release of emboli, causing stroke in about 1.5%; microemboli may contribute to post-CPB neuropsychiatric effects, which appear in about 5 to 10%.\\nOther common complications of CABG include focal and global myocardial ischemia and dysrhythmias.Perioperative MI occurs in about 1% of patients. Atrial fibrillation occurs in 15 to 40% of patients, typically2 to 4 days after surgery. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia may occur in up to 50% of patients.\\nMortality depends mainly on patients' underlying health; operator and institutional experience (ie, numberof annual procedures) also is important. In an experienced program, periprocedural mortality in otherwisehealthy patients is typically < 1 to 3%.\\nAlternative CABG Procedures\\nNewer techniques seek to limit the complications of traditional CABG by\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 207.

Various devices and methods stabilize a portion of the myocardium, holding theoperative site relatively motionless. Off-pump procedures are more commonly done through smallparasternal or intercostal incisions (minimally invasive CABG), sometimes with endoscopy or even roboticassistance, but they may be done through a traditional median sternotomy, which provides betteroperative exposure.\\nAllowing the heart to beat means that the myocardium requires more O2 than when CPB is used. Thus,the heart is sensitive to the interruption of blood flow necessitated while the vascular anastomosis isdone; this interruption can cause ischemia or infarction in the myocardium supplied by the affectedvessel. Some surgeons place a temporary coronary artery shunt to provide distal perfusion.\\nThe minimally invasive technique is somewhat more difficult to do and may not be suitable when multiplebypass grafts, particularly those involving vessels behind the heart, are required. Transfusionrequirements, length of stay, and costs are typically less with off-pump CABG, but in some studies, therate of the more serious complications of death, MI, and stroke are similar to that of CABG using CPB.Thus, the theoretic advantages of avoiding CPB do not seem to have been fully realized.\\nMinimally invasive CABG is usually done off-pump but may be done using CPB. In such cases, CPB isdone endovascularly using special catheters inserted into the arterial and venous systems; the aorta isoccluded by a balloon at the end of the aortic catheter rather than an external clamp. Although avoidingmedian sternotomy complications, this technique otherwise has similar rates of mortality and majorperioperative complications as conventional techniques.\\nEchocardiography\\nEchocardiography uses ultrasound waves to produce an image of the heart and great vessels. It helpsassess heart wall thickness (eg, in hypertrophy or atrophy) and motion and provides information aboutischemia and infarction. It can be used to assess diastolic filling patterns of the left ventricle, which canhelp in the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy, severeheart failure, constrictive pericarditis, and severe aortic regurgitation.\\nTechniques: There are 2 techniques for doing echocardiography:\\n• Transthoracic\\n• Transesophageal\\nIn transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), the most common technique, a transducer is placed along theleft or right sternal border, at the cardiac apex, at the suprasternal notch (to allow visualization of theaortic valve, left ventricular outflow tract, and descending aorta), or over the subxiphoid region. TTEprovides 2- or 3-dimensional tomographic images of most major cardiac structures.\\nIn transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), a transducer on the tip of an endoscope allows visualizationof the heart via the esophagus. TEE is used to assess cardiac disorders when transthoracic study istechnically difficult, as in obese patients and in patients with COPD. It reveals better detail of smallabnormal structures (eg, endocarditic vegetations or patent foramen ovale) and posterior cardiacstructures (eg, left atrium, left atrial appendage, interatrial septum) because they are closer to theesophagus than to the anterior chest wall. TEE can also produce images of the ascending aorta, whicharises behind the 3rd costal cartilage; of structures < 3 mm (eg, thrombi, vegetations); and of prostheticvalves.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 207.

Agitated saline develops microbubbles, which produce a cloud of echoes in the rightcardiac chambers and which, if a septal defect is present, appear on the left side of the heart. Usually, themicrobubbles do not traverse the pulmonary capillary bed; however, one agent, sonicated albuminmicrobubbles, can do so and can enter left heart structures after IV injection.\\nSpectral Doppler echocardiography can record velocity, direction, and type of blood flow. Thistechnique is useful for detecting abnormal blood flow (eg, due to regurgitant lesions) or velocity (eg, dueto stenotic lesions). Spectral Doppler echocardiography does not provide spatial information about thesize or shape of the heart or its structures.\\nColor Doppler echocardiography combines 2-dimensional and spectral Doppler echocardiography toprovide information about the size and shape of the heart and its structures as well as the velocity of anddirection of blood flow around the valves and outflow tracts. Color is used to code blood flow information;by convention, red is toward and blue away from the transducer.\\nTissue Doppler imaging uses Doppler techniques to measure the velocity of myocardial tissuecontraction (rather than of blood flow). These data can be used to calculate myocardial strain(percentage change in length between contraction and relaxation) and myocardial strain rate (rate ofchange in length). Strain and strain rate measurements can help assess systolic and diastolic functionand identify ischemia during stress testing.\\nStress echocardiography: TTE is an alternative to radionuclide imaging to identify myocardial ischemiaduring and after exercise or pharmacologic stress. Stress echocardiography shows regional wall motionabnormalities that result from an imbalance in blood flow in epicardial coronary vessels during stress.Computer programs can provide side-by-side assessment of ventricular contraction during systole anddiastole at rest and under stress. Exercise and pharmacologic protocols are the same as those used inradionuclide stress testing. Stress echocardiography and radionuclide stress testing detect ischemiaequally well. The choice between tests is often based on availability, the provider's experience, and cost.\\nElectrocardiography\\nThe standard ECG provides 12 different vector views of the heart's electrical activity as reflected byelectrical potential differences between positive and negative electrodes placed on the limbs and chestwall. Six of these views are vertical (using frontal leads I, II, and III and limb leads aVR, aVL, and aVF),and 6 are horizontal (using precordial leads V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6). The 12-lead ECG is crucial forestablishing many cardiac diagnoses, especially arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia (seeTable 207-4). It can also identify atrial enlargement, ventricular hypertrophy (seeTable 207-5), and conditions that predispose to syncope or sudden death (eg, Wolff-Parkinson-Whitesyndrome, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome).\\nStandard ECG Components\\nBy convention, the ECG tracing is divided into the P wave, PR interval, QRS complex, QT interval, STsegment, T wave, and U wave (seeFig. 207-2).\\nP wave: The P wave represents atrial depolarization. It is upright in most leads except aVR. It may bebiphasic in leads II and V1; the initial component represents right atrial activity, and the 2nd componentrepresents left atrial activity.\\nAn increase in amplitude of either or both components occurs with atrial enlargement. Right atrialenlargement produces a P wave > 2 mm in leads II, III, and aVF (P pulmonale); left atrial enlargementproduces a P wave that is broad and double-peaked in lead II (P mitrale). Normally, the P axis is between0° and 75°.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 207.

The Q wave is the initialdownward deflection; normal Q waves last < 0.05 sec in all leads except V1-3, in which any Q wave isconsidered abnormal, indicating past or current infarction. The R wave is the first upward deflection;criteria for normal height or size are not absolute, but taller R waves may be caused by ventricularhypertrophy. A 2nd upward deflection in a QRS complex is designated R´. The S wave is the 2nddownward deflection if there is a Q wave and the first downward deflection if not. The QRS complex maybe R alone, QS (no R), QR (no S), RS (no Q), or RSR´, depending on the ECG lead, vector, andpresence of heart disorders.\\nNormally, the QRS interval is 0.07 to 0.10 sec.

Theyare labeled V1R to V6R; sometimes only V4R is used, because it is the most sensitive for right ventricularMI.\\nAdditional left-sided leads can be placed in the 5th intercostal space, with V7 at the posterior axillary line,V8 at the midscapular line, and V9 at the left border of the spine.

These findings represent areas of slow conduction through abnormal myocardium,indicating increased risk of reentrant ventricular tachycardia. Signal-averaged ECG is still largely aresearch technique but is occasionally used to assess risk of sudden cardiac death (eg, in post-MIpatients without evidence of conduction delay, patients with myocardial ischemia and unexplainedsyncope, and those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy) and to assess efficacy of surgery to correct thearrhythmia.

Signal averaging of P waves is being studied as away to identify patients at risk of atrial fibrillation.\\nContinuous ST-segment monitoring: This type of monitoring is used for early detection of ischemiaand serious arrhythmias. Monitoring can be automated (dedicated electronic monitoring units areavailable) or done clinically using serial ECGs. Applications include emergency department monitoring ofpatients with crescendo angina, evaluation after percutaneous intervention, intraoperative monitoring, andpostoperative care.\\nQT dispersion: QT dispersion (the difference between the longest and shortest QT intervals on a 12-lead ECG) has been proposed as a measure of myocardial repolarization heterogeneity. Increaseddispersion suggests electrically heterogeneous myocardium caused by ischemia or fibrosis, withincreased risk of reentrant arrhythmias and sudden death. QT dispersion predicts mortality risk but is notwidely measured because measurement error is common, values in patients with and without diseaseoverlap substantially, there is no reference standard, and other validated risk predictors are available.\\nHeart rate variability: This measurement reflects the balance between sympathetic andparasympathetic (vagal) input to the heart. Decreased variability suggests decreased vagal input andincreased sympathetic input, which predict increased risk of arrhythmias and mortality. The most commonmeasure of variability is the mean of the standard deviations of all normal R-R intervals in a 24-h ECGrecording. Heart rate variability is used primarily in research, but evidence suggests that it provides usefulinformation about left ventricular dysfunction after MI, heart failure, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Most Holter monitors have software that measures and analyzes heart rate variability.\\nHolter monitor: Holter monitoring is continuous monitoring and recording of the ECG, BP, or both for 24or 48 h. It is useful for evaluating intermittent arrhythmias and, secondarily, for detecting hypertension.The Holter monitor is portable, enabling patients to participate in normal daily activities; it may also beused for sedentary hospitalized patients if automated monitoring is unavailable. Patients are asked torecord symptoms and activities so that they may be correlated with events on the monitor. The Holtermonitor does not automatically analyze the ECG data; a physician does so at a later date.\\nEvent recorder: Event recorders are worn for up to 30 days and can detect infrequent rhythmdisturbances that 24-h Holter monitoring may miss. The recorder does not operate continuously but isactivated by the patient when symptoms occur. A memory loop enables information to be stored forseconds or minutes before and after activation. The patient can transmit ECG data by telephone to beread by a physician. If patients have serious events (eg, syncope) at intervals of > 30 days, an eventrecorder may be placed subcutaneously; it can be activated by a small magnet. Battery life forsubcutaneous recorders is 14 mo.\\nElectrophysiologic Studies\\nIn electrophysiologic studies, recording and stimulating electrodes are inserted via right- or left-sidedcardiac catheterization into all 4 cardiac chambers. Atria are paced from the right or left atrium, ventriclesare paced from the right ventricular apex or right ventricular outflow tract, and cardiac conduction isrecorded. Programmed stimulation techniques may be used to trigger and terminate a reentrantarrhythmia.\\nElectrophysiologic studies are indicated primarily for evaluation and treatment of arrhythmias that aredifficult to capture, serious, or sustained. These studies may be used to make a primary diagnosis, toevaluate the efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs, or to map arrhythmia foci before radiofrequency catheterablation (see p. 2161). Various mapping techniques are available.\\nCardiac Imaging Tests\\nStandard imaging tests include echocardiography (see p. 2053), chest x-ray, CT, MRI, and variousradionuclide techniques (see p. 2061).

CT gating thatuses the ECG to trigger the x-ray beam at the desired portion of the cardiac cycle gives less x-rayexposure than gating that simply reconstructs information from only the desired portion of the cardiaccycle (gated reconstruction) and does not interrupt the x-ray beam.\\nChest x-rays: Chest x-rays are often useful as a starting point in a cardiac diagnosis. Posteroanteriorand lateral views provide a gross view of atrial and ventricular size and shape and pulmonaryvasculature, but additional tests are almost always required for precise characterization of cardiacstructure and function.\\nCT: Spiral (helical) CT may be used to evaluate pericarditis, congenital cardiac disorders (especiallyabnormal arteriovenous connections), disorders of the great vessels (eg, aortic aneurysm, aorticdissection), cardiac tumors, acute pulmonary embolism, chronic pulmonary thromboembolic disease, andarrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. However, CT requires a radiopaque dye, which may limit itsuse in patients with renal impairment.\\nElectron beam CT, formerly called ultrafast CT or cine CT, unlike conventional CT, does not use amoving x-ray source and target. Instead, the direction of the x-ray beam is guided by a magnetic field anddetected by an array of stationary detectors. Because mechanical motion is not required, images can beacquired in a fraction of a second (and targeted to a specific point in the cardiac cycle). Electron beamCT is used primarily to detect and quantify coronary artery calcification, an early sign of atherosclerosis.However, spatial resolution is poor and the equipment cannot be used for noncardiac disorders, so newerstandard CT techniques are becoming preferred for cardiac use.\\nMultidetector CT (MDCT), with ≥ 64 detectors, has a very rapid scan time; some advanced machinesmay generate an image from a single heartbeat, although typical acquisition times are 30 sec. Dual-source CT uses 2 x-ray sources and 2 multidetector arrays on a single gantry, which cuts scan time inhalf. Both of these modalities appear able to identify coronary calcifications and flow-limiting (ie, > 50%stenosis) coronary artery obstruction. Typically, an IV contrast agent is used, although nonenhancedscans can detect coronary artery calcification.\\nMDCT is currently used mainly for patients with indeterminate stress imaging test results as anoninvasive alternative to coronary angiography. However, radiation dose is significant, about 15 mSv (vs0.1 mSv for a chest x-ray and 7 mSv for coronary angiography). The presence of high-density calcifiedplaques creates imaging artifacts that interfere with interpretation.\\nMRI: Standard MRI is useful for evaluating areas around the heart, particularly the mediastinum andgreat vessels (eg, for studying aneurysms, dissections, and stenoses). With ECG-gated data acquisition,image resolution can approach that of CT or echocardiography, clearly delineating myocardial wallthickness and motion, chamber volumes, intraluminal masses or clot, and valve planes. Sequential MRIafter injecting a paramagnetic contrast agent (gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid [Gd-DTPA])produces higher resolution of myocardial perfusion patterns than does radionuclide imaging. However,patients with impaired renal function can develop nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, a potentially life-threatening disorder, after use of gadolinium contrast. Using contrast, 3-dimensional information on infarctsize and location can be obtained, and blood flow velocities in cardiac chambers can be measured. MRIcan assess tissue viability by assessing the contractile response to inotropic stimulation with dobutamineor by using a contrast agent (eg, Gd-DTPA, which is excluded from cells with intact membranes).\\nMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is used to assess blood volumes of interest (eg, bloodvessels in the chest or abdomen); all blood flow can be assessed simultaneously. MRA can be used todetect aneurysms, stenosis, or occlusions in the carotid, coronary, renal, or peripheral arteries. Use ofthis technique to detect deep venous thrombosis is being studied.\\nPET: PET can demonstrate myocardial perfusion and metabolism.\\nPerfusion agents include carbon-11 (11C) CO2, oxygen-15 (15O) water, nitrogen-13 (13N) ammonia, and\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 207.

FDG detectsthe enhancement of glucose metabolism under ischemic conditions, and can thus distinguish ischemic butstill viable myocardium from scar tissue. Sensitivity is greater than with myocardial perfusion imaging,possibly making FDG imaging useful for selecting patients for revascularization and for avoiding suchprocedures when only scar tissue is present. This use may justify the greater expense of PET. Half-life of18F is long enough (110 min) that FDG can often be produced off-site. Techniques that enable FDGimaging to be used with conventional single-photon emission CT (SPECT) cameras may make this typeof imaging widely available.\\nUptake of 11C acetate appears to reflect overall O2 metabolism by myocytes. Uptake does not depend on\\nsuch potentially variable factors as blood glucose levels, which can affect FDG distribution. 11C acetateimaging may better predict postintervention recovery of myocardial function than FDG imaging. However,because of a 20-min half-life, 11C must be produced by an on-site cyclotron.\\nPercutaneous Coronary Interventions\\nPercutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) include percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty(PTCA) with or without stenting. Primary indications are treatment of angina pectoris (stable or unstable),myocardial ischemia, and acute MI (particularly in patients with developing or established cardiogenicshock). Primary PTCA and stent placement within 90 min of onset of pain is the optimal treatment oftransmural ST-segment-elevation MI. Elective PCI may be appropriate for post-MI patients who haverecurrent or inducible angina before hospital discharge and for patients who have angina and remainsymptomatic despite medical treatment. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is used to treatperipheral arterial disease (see p. 2220).\\nProcedure: PTCA is done via percutaneous femoral, radial, or brachial artery puncture. A guidingcatheter is inserted into a large peripheral artery and threaded to the appropriate coronary ostium. Aballoon-tipped catheter, guided by fluoroscopy or intravascular ultrasonography, is aligned within thestenosis, then inflated to disrupt the atherosclerotic plaque and dilate the artery. Angiography is repeatedafter the procedure to document any changes. The procedure is commonly done in 2 or 3 vessels asneeded.\\nStents: Stents are most useful for\\n• Short lesions in large native coronary arteries not previously treated with PTCA\\n• Focal lesions in saphenous vein grafts\\n• Treatment of abrupt closure during PTCA\\nThe role of stenting in acute MI, ostial or left main disease, chronic total occlusions, and bifurcationlesions is still evolving.\\nTypes of stents: Bare metal stents (BMS) are made of nickel-titanium alloy. Drug eluting stents (DES)have drugs (eg, sirolimus, paclitaxel) bonded to the metal that limit neointimal proliferation to reduce therisk of restenosis. In intracoronary brachytherapy, the site of stenosis is exposed to radiation in the formof small pellets embedded in a nylon ribbon temporarily (eg, 30 min) placed in the coronary artery prior tostenting. This technique appears to decrease the risk of early restenosis, but it is unclear whether laterstenosis is slightly increased; trials are ongoing. Radioactive stents have not proven effective at limitingrestenosis.\\nAnticoagulation: Various anticoagulation regimens are used during and after angioplasty to reduce theincidence of thrombosis at the site of balloon dilation.

Stent thrombosis may be due toinadequate stent expansion or apposition at the time of the procedure, discontinuation of dual antiplatelettherapy (eg, from nonadherence, need for noncardiac surgery), or both.\\nRestenosis is typically due to collagen deposition and thus does not occur until several weeks after theprocedure or later; it may cause partial or, less commonly, complete vessel blockage.\\nWith balloon angioplasty, risk of acute thrombosis is about 5 to 10%, risk of subacute restenosis is about5%, and the overall restenosis rate is about 30 to 45%. Use of stents has almost eliminated the need foremergency coronary artery bypass grafting following PCI. With stenting, the rate of acute and subacutethrombosis or restenosis is < 1%. With BMS, risk of late restenosis is decreased to 20 to 30%. Use of aDES lowers late restenosis risk to about 5 to 10%. However, using a DES increases risk of late stentthrombosis, about 0.6%/yr up to 3 yr.\\nComplications besides restenosis are similar to those of coronary angiography, although risk of death, MI,and stroke is greater. Of all angiographic procedures, PCI has the highest risk of contrast nephropathy;this risk can be reduced by preprocedural hydration and possibly by use of a nonionic contrast agent,acetylcysteine, or hemofiltration in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency. Stenting, in addition to theabove, has complications of bleeding secondary to aggressive adjunctive anticoagulation, side branchocclusion, and stent embolism.\\nRadionuclide Imaging\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 207.

This test is done to evaluate coronary artery disease (CAD), valvular or congenitalcardiac disorders, cardiomyopathy, and other cardiac disorders. Radionuclide imaging exposes patients toless radiation than do comparable x-ray studies. However, because the radioactive material is retained inthe patient briefly, sophisticated radiation alarms (eg, in airports) may be triggered by the patient forseveral days after such testing.\\nSingle-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT): Planar techniques, which produce a 2-dimensional image, are rarely used; SPECT, which uses a rotating camera system and tomographicreconstruction to produce a 3-dimensional image, is more common in the US. With multihead SPECTsystems, imaging can often be completed in ≤ 10 min. Visual comparison of stress and delayed imagescan be supplemented by quantitative displays. With SPECT, inferior and posterior abnormalities and smallareas of infarction and the vessels responsible for infarction can be identified. The mass of infarcted andviable myocardium can be quantified, helping determine prognosis.\\nMyocardial Perfusion Imaging\\nIn myocardial perfusion imaging, IV radionuclides are taken up by cardiac tissues in rough proportion toperfusion; thus, areas of decreased uptake represent areas of relative or absolute ischemia. For thisreason, myocardial perfusion imaging is used with stress testing to evaluate patients with chest pain ofuncertain origin, to determine the functional significance of coronary artery stenosis or collateral vesselsseen on angiography, and to evaluate the success of reperfusion interventions (eg, coronary arterybypass grafting [CABG], percutaneous intervention, thrombolysis). After acute MI, myocardial perfusionimaging can help estimate prognosis because it can show extent of the perfusion abnormality due toacute MI, extent of scarring due to previous infarcts, and residual peri-infarct or other areas of reversibleischemia.\\nRadioactive thallium-201 (201Tl), which acts as a K analog, was the original tracer used in stress testing.It is injected at peak stress and imaged with SPECT, followed 4 h later by injection of one half the originaldose during rest and by repeat SPECT. The goal of this protocol is to evaluate reversible perfusiondefects that may warrant intervention. After stress testing, the perfusion imbalance between normalcoronary arteries and those distal to a stenosis appears as a relative decrease in 201Tl uptake in theareas perfused by the stenosed arteries. Sensitivity of stress testing with 201Tl for CAD is similar whetherimaging is done after exercise or pharmacologic stress.\\nBecause the imaging characteristics of 201Tl are not ideal for the gamma camera, several technetium-99m (99mTc) myocardial perfusion markers have been developed: sestamibi (commonly used),tetrofosmin, and teboroxime (seeTable 207-6). Protocols\\n[Table 207-6. Technetium-99M Myocardial Perfusion Markers]\\ninclude 2-day stress-rest, 1-day rest-stress, and 1-day stress-rest. Some protocols use dual isotopes(201Tl and 99mTc), although this approach is expensive. With either of these markers, sensitivity is about90%, and specificity is about 71%.\\nFor 2-day protocols, imaging at rest may be omitted if the initial stress test shows no evidence ofabnormal perfusion. When higher doses of 99mTc (> 30 mCi) are used, first-transit function studies (withventriculography) may be used with perfusion imaging.\\nOther radionuclides include iodine-123 (123I)-labeled fatty acids, which produces cold spots wheremyocardium is ischemic; gallium citrate-67 (67Ga), which accumulates in sites of active inflammation (eg,in acute inflammatory cardiomyopathy); and 123I metaiodobenzylguanidine, a neurotransmitter analogtaken up and stored in neurons of the sympathetic nervous system and used in research to evaluateheart failure, diabetes, certain arrhythmias, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 207.

Attenuation bybreast tissue in women is especially common. Attenuation by the diaphragm and abdominal contents mayproduce spurious inferior wall defects in both sexes but is more common among men. Attenuation is morelikely with 99mTc than with 201Tl.\\nInfarct Avid Imaging\\nInfarct avid imaging uses radiolabeled markers that accumulate in areas of damaged myocardium, suchas 99mTc pyrophosphate and antimyosin (indium-111 [111In]-labeled antibodies to cardiac myosin).Images usually become positive 12 to 24 h after acute MI and remain positive for about 1 wk; they mayremain positive if myocardial necrosis continues post-MI or if aneurysms develop. This technique is rarelyused now because other diagnostic tests for MI (eg, biomarkers) are more readily available and lessexpensive and because it provides no prognostic information other than infarct size.\\nRadionuclide Ventriculography\\nRadionuclide ventriculography is used to evaluate ventricular function. It is useful for measuring restingand exercise ejection fraction in CAD, valvular heart disease, and congenital heart disease. Someclinicians prefer it for serial assessment of ventricular function in patients taking cardiotoxic cancerchemotherapy (eg, anthracyclines). However, radionuclide ventriculography has been largely replaced byechocardiography, which is less expensive, does not require radiation exposure, and theoretically canmeasure ejection fractions as accurately.\\n99mTc-labeled RBCs are injected into the ventricles. Left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV)function can be evaluated by first-transit studies (a type of beat-to-beat evaluation) or by gated (ECG-synchronized) blood pool imaging done over several minutes (multiple-gated acquisition [MUGA]). Eitherstudy can be done during rest or after exercise. First-transit studies are rapid and relatively easy, butMUGA provides better images and is more widely used.\\nIn first-transit studies, 8 to 10 cardiac cycles are imaged as the marker mixes with blood and passesthrough the central circulation. First-transit studies are ideal for assessing RV function and intracardiacshunts.\\nIn MUGA, imaging is synchronized with the R wave of the ECG. Multiple images are taken of short,sequential portions of each cardiac cycle for 5 to 10 min. Computer analysis generates an average bloodpool configuration for each portion of the cardiac cycle and synthesizes the configurations into acontinuous cinematic loop resembling a beating heart.\\nMUGA can quantitate numerous indexes of ventricular function, including regional wall motion, ejectionfraction (EF); ratio of stroke volume to end-diastolic volume, ejection and filling rates, LV volume, andindexes of relative volume overload (eg, LV:RV stroke volume ratios). EF is used most commonly.\\nMUGA during rest has virtually no risk. It is used for serially evaluating RV and LV function in variousdisorders (eg, valvular heart disorders); for monitoring patients taking potentially cardiotoxic drugs (eg,doxorubicin); and for assessing the effects of angioplasty, CABG, thrombolysis, and other procedures inpatients with CAD or MI. Arrhythmias are a relative contraindication because there may be few normalcardiac cycles.\\nLV: MUGA is useful for detecting LV aneurysms; sensitivity and specificity are > 90% for typical anterioror anteroapical true aneurysms. Conventional gated blood pool imaging shows inferoposterior LVaneurysms less well than it shows anterior and lateral aneurysms; additional views are required. GatedSPECT imaging takes longer (about 20 to 25 min with a multihead camera) than a single planar gatedview (5 to 10 min) but shows all portions of the ventricles.\\nRV: MUGA is used to assess RV function in patients who have a lung disorder or an inferior LV infarctthat may involve the RV. Normally, RVEF (40 to 55% with most techniques) is lower than LVEF. RVEF is\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 207.

Idiopathic cardiomyopathy is usually characterized by biventriculardysfunction, unlike typical CAD, which usually causes more LV than RV dysfunction.\\nValves: MUGA can be used with rest-stress protocols to assess valvular disorders that result in LVvolume overload. In aortic regurgitation, a reduction in resting EF or no increase in EF with exercise is asign of deteriorating cardiac function and may indicate a need for valvular repair. MUGA also can be usedto calculate the regurgitant fraction in regurgitation of any valve. Normally, the stroke volume of the 2ventricles is equal. However, in patients with left-sided valvular regurgitation, LV stroke volume exceedsthat of the RV by an amount proportional to the regurgitant fraction. Thus, if the RV is normal, theregurgitant fraction of the LV can be calculated from the LV:RV stroke volume ratio.\\nShunts: With MUGA and commercially available computer programs, size of a congenital shunt can bequantified by the stroke volume ratio or, during the first transit of the marker, by the ratio of abnormal earlypulmonary recirculation of radioactivity to total pulmonary radioactivity.\\nStress Testing\\nIn stress testing, the heart is monitored by ECG and often imaging studies during an induced episode ofincreased cardiac demand so that ischemic areas potentially at risk of infarction can be identified. Heartrate is increased to 85% of age-predicted maximum (target heart rate) or until symptoms develop,whichever occurs first.\\nStress testing is used for diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) and for risk stratification andmonitoring of patients with known CAD. In patients with CAD, a blood supply that is adequate at rest maybe inadequate when cardiac demands are increased by exercise or other forms of stress. Stress testing isless invasive and less expensive than cardiac catheterization, and it detects pathophysiologicabnormalities of blood flow; however, it is less accurate for diagnosis in patients with a low pretestlikelihood of CAD. It can define the functional significance of abnormalities in coronary artery anatomyidentified with coronary angiography during catheterization. Because coronary artery plaques that are notsignificantly stenotic (ie, do not result in ischemia during stress testing) may nonetheless rupture andcause an acute coronary syndrome, a normal stress test result does not guarantee future freedom fromMI.\\nRisks of stress testing include infarction and sudden death, which occur in about 1/5000 patients tested.Stress testing has several contraindications (seeTable 207-7). Patients must be npo for 4 to 6 h before the test.\\nStress Methodology\\nCardiac demand can be increased by exercise or drugs.\\n[Table 207-7. Contraindications to Exercise Stress Testing]\\nExercise stress testing: Exercise is preferred to drugs for increasing cardiac demand because it moreclosely replicates ischemia-inducing stressors. Usually, a patient walks on a conventional treadmill,following the Bruce protocol or a similar exercise schedule, until the target heart rate is reached orsymptoms occur. The Bruce protocol increases treadmill speed and slope incrementally at roughly 3-minintervals.\\nPharmacologic stress testing: Pharmacologic stress testing is usually used when patients cannot walkon a treadmill long enough to reach their target heart rate because of deconditioning, musculoskeletaldisorders, obesity, peripheral arterial disease, or other disorders. Drugs used include IV dipyridamole,adenosine, and dobutamine.\\nDipyridamole augments endogenous adenosine, causing coronary artery vasodilation.

ECG is mostuseful in patients with intermediate likelihood of CAD based on age and sex and with a normal ECG atrest. Diagnosis involves assessment of ST-segment response (a measure of global subendocardialischemia), BP response, and the patient's symptoms. Average sensitivity is 67%; average specificity is72%. Sensitivity and specificity are lower in women partly because incidence of CAD is lower in youngand middle-aged women. Prognosis worsens with depth of ST depression.\\nRadionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (see p. 2061) is more sensitive (85 to 90%) and specific(70 to 80%) than ECG stress testing; combining findings from both tests increases sensitivity for CAD.Myocardial perfusion imaging is particularly useful for patients with baseline ECG abnormalities that mayinterfere with interpretation of ECG changes during a stress test (eg, patients with bundle branch block,those with fixed-rate pacemakers, those taking digitalis). It is also useful for groups with a high probabilityof false-positive results on exercise ECGs (eg, premenopausal women, patients with mitral valveprolapse). This imaging test can help determine the functional significance of coronary artery stenosis,identified by coronary angiography, when surgeons are choosing lesions to bypass or dilate viapercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.\\nEchocardiography is useful when information about more than just perfusion is needed;echocardiography detects wall motion abnormalities that are a sign of regional ischemia and, usingDoppler techniques, helps evaluate valvular disorders that may contribute to or result from ischemia orvalvular disorders unrelated to ischemia but which deserve concomitant evaluation (see p. 2053). Theechocardiogram is typically obtained immediately before and after an exercise treadmill test or duringdobutamine infusion. Echocardiography is relatively portable, does not use ionizing radiation, has a rapidacquisition time, and is inexpensive, but it is difficult to carry out in obese patients and in patients withCOPD and lung hyperinflation. Done by experts, stress echocardiography has a predictive value similar tothat of stress myocardial radionuclide perfusion testing.\\nRadionuclide ventriculography is occasionally used with exercise stress testing instead ofechocardiography to assess exercise ejection fraction (EF), the best prognostic indicator in patients with\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 207.

After the patient remains supine for 15min, the table is tilted nearly upright to 60 to 80° for 45 min. If vasovagal symptoms develop, vasovagalsyncope is confirmed.

Arterial Hypertension\\nIntroduction\\nHypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic BP (≥ 140 mm Hg), diastolic BP (≥ 90 mmHg), or both. Hypertension with no known cause (primary; formerly, essential hypertension) ismost common. Hypertension with an identified cause (secondary hypertension) is usually dueto a renal disorder. Usually, no symptoms develop unless hypertension is severe or long-standing. Diagnosis is by sphygmomanometry. Tests may be done to determine cause, assessdamage, and identify other cardiovascular risk factors. Treatment involves lifestyle changes anddrugs, including diuretics, β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and Cachannel blockers.\\nIn the US, about 65 million people have hypertension. Only about 70% of these people are aware thatthey have hypertension, only 59% are being treated, and only 34% have adequately controlled BP. Inadults, hypertension occurs more often in blacks (32%) than in whites (23%) or Mexican Americans(23%), and morbidity and mortality are greater in blacks.\\nBP increases with age. About two thirds of people > 65 have hypertension, and people with a normal BPat age 55 have a 90% lifetime risk of developing hypertension. Because hypertension becomes socommon with age, the age-related increase in BP may seem innocuous, but higher BP increasesmorbidity and mortality risk. Hypertension may develop during pregnancy (see pp. 2645 and 2670).\\nEtiology\\nHypertension may be primary (85 to 95% of cases) or secondary.\\nPrimary hypertension: Hemodynamics and physiologic components (eg, plasma volume, activity of therenin-angiotensin system) vary, indicating that primary hypertension is unlikely to have a single cause.Even if one factor is initially responsible, multiple factors are probably involved in sustaining elevated BP(the mosaic theory). In afferent systemic arterioles, malfunction of ion pumps on sarcolemmal membranesof smooth muscle cells may lead to chronically increased vascular tone. Heredity is a predisposing factor,but the exact mechanism is unclear. Environmental factors (eg, dietary Na, obesity, stress) seem to affectonly genetically susceptible people.\\nSecondary hypertension: Causes include renal parenchymal disease (eg, chronic glomerulonephritisor pyelonephritis, polycystic renal disease, connective tissue disorders, obstructive uropathy),renovascular disease (see p. 2077), pheochromocytoma, Cushing's syndrome, primary aldosteronism,congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hyperthyroidism, myxedema, and coarctation of the aorta. Excessivealcohol intake and use of oral contraceptives are common causes of curable hypertension. Use ofsympathomimetics, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, cocaine, or licorice commonly contributes to hypertension.\\nPathophysiology\\nBecause BP equals cardiac output (CO) × total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR), pathogenicmechanisms must involve increased CO, increased TPR, or both.\\nIn most patients, CO is normal or slightly increased, and TPR is increased. This pattern is typical ofprimary hypertension and hypertension due to pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism, renovasculardisease, and renal parenchymal disease.\\nIn other patients, CO is increased (possibly because of venoconstriction in large veins), and TPR isinappropriately normal for the level of CO. Later in the disorder, TPR increases and CO returns to normal,probably because of autoregulation. Some disorders that increase CO (thyrotoxicosis, arteriovenousfistula, aortic regurgitation), particularly when stroke volume is increased, cause isolated systolichypertension. Some elderly patients have isolated systolic hypertension with normal or low CO, probablydue to inelasticity of the aorta and its major branches.

Renal blood flow graduallydecreases as diastolic BP increases and arteriolar sclerosis begins. GFR remains normal until late in thedisorder; as a result, the filtration fraction is increased. Coronary, cerebral, and muscle blood flow ismaintained unless severe atherosclerosis coexists in these vascular beds.\\nAbnormal Na transport: In many cases of hypertension, Na transport across the cell wall is abnormal,because the Na-K pump (Na+, K+-ATPase) is defective or inhibited or because permeability to Na+ isincreased. The result is increased intracellular Na, which makes the cell more sensitive to sympatheticstimulation. Ca follows Na, so accumulation of intracellular Ca may be responsible for the increasedsensitivity. Because Na+, K+-ATPase may pump norepinephrine back into sympathetic neurons (thusinactivating this neurotransmitter), inhibition of this mechanism could also enhance the effect ofnorepinephrine, increasing BP. Defects in Na transport may occur in normotensive children ofhypertensive parents.\\nSympathetic nervous system: Sympathetic stimulation increases BP, usually more in patients withprehypertension (systolic BP 120 to 139 mm Hg, diastolic BP 80 to 89 mm Hg) or hypertension (systolicBP ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or both) than in normotensive patients. Whether thishyperresponsiveness resides in the sympathetic nervous system or in the myocardium and vascularsmooth muscle is unknown. A high resting pulse rate, which may result from increased sympatheticnervous activity, is a well-known predictor of hypertension. In some hypertensive patients, circulatingplasma catecholamine levels during rest are higher than normal.\\nRenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system: This system helps regulate blood volume and therefore BP.Renin, an enzyme formed in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, catalyzes conversion of angiotensinogen toangiotensin I. This inactive product is cleaved by ACE, mainly in the lungs but also in the kidneys andbrain, to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that also stimulates autonomic centers in the brain toincrease sympathetic discharge and stimulates release of aldosterone and ADH. Aldosterone and ADHcause Na and water retention, elevating BP. Aldosterone also enhances K excretion; low plasma K (< 3.5mEq/L) increases vasoconstriction through closure of K channels. Angiotensin III, present in thecirculation, stimulates aldosterone release as actively as angiotensin II but has much less pressor activity.Because chymase enzymes also convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II, drugs that inhibit ACE do not fullysuppress angiotensin II production.\\nRenin secretion is controlled by at least 4 mechanisms, which are not mutually exclusive: (1) A renalvascular receptor responds to changes in tension in the afferent arteriolar wall; (2) a macula densareceptor detects changes in the delivery rate or concentration of NaCl in the distal tubule; (3) circulatingangiotensin has a negative feedback effect on renin secretion; and (4) via the renal nerve, thesympathetic nervous system stimulates renin secretion mediated by β-receptors.\\nAngiotensin is generally acknowledged to be responsible for renovascular hypertension, at least in theearly phase, but the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in primary hypertension is notestablished. However, in black and elderly patients with hypertension, renin levels tend to be low. Theelderly also tend to have low angiotensin II levels.\\nHypertension due to chronic renal parenchymal disease (renoprival hypertension) results from thecombination of a renin-dependent mechanism and a volume-dependent mechanism. In most cases,increased renin activity is not evident in peripheral blood. Hypertension is typically moderate andsensitive to Na and water balance.\\nVasodilator deficiency: Deficiency of a vasodilator (eg, bradykinin, nitric oxide) rather than excess of avasoconstrictor (eg, angiotensin, norepinephrine) may cause hypertension. If the kidneys do not produceadequate amounts of vasodilators (because of renal parenchymal disease or bilateral nephrectomy), BPcan increase. Vasodilators and vasoconstrictors (mainly endothelin) are also produced in endothelialcells. Therefore, endothelial dysfunction greatly affects BP.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 208.

Severe orprolonged hypertension damages target organs (primarily the cardiovascular system, brain, and kidneys),increasing risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), MI, stroke (particularly hemorrhagic), and renal failure.The mechanism involves development of generalized arteriolosclerosis and acceleration of atherogenesis(see p. 2081). Arteriolosclerosis is characterized by medial hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and hyalinization; itis particularly apparent in small arterioles, notably in the eyes and the kidneys. In the kidneys, thechanges narrow the arteriolar lumen, increasing TPR; thus, hypertension leads to more hypertension.Furthermore, once arteries are narrowed, any slight additional shortening of already hypertrophiedsmooth muscle reduces the lumen to a greater extent than in normal-diameter arteries. These effects mayexplain why the longer hypertension has existed, the less likely specific treatment (eg, renovascularsurgery) for secondary causes is to restore BP to normal.\\nBecause of increased afterload, the left ventricle gradually hypertrophies, causing diastolic dysfunction.The ventricle eventually dilates, causing dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure (HF) due to systolicdysfunction. Thoracic aortic dissection is typically a consequence of hypertension; almost all patients withabdominal aortic aneurysms have hypertension.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nHypertension is usually asymptomatic until complications develop in target organs. Dizziness, flushedfacies, headache, fatigue, epistaxis, and nervousness are not caused by uncomplicated hypertension.Severe hypertension (hypertensive emergencies—see p. 2078) can cause severe cardiovascular,neurologic, renal, and retinal symptoms (eg, symptomatic coronary atherosclerosis, HF, hypertensiveencephalopathy, renal failure).\\nA 4th heart sound is one of the earliest signs of hypertensive heart disease.\\nRetinal changes may include arteriolar narrowing, hemorrhages, exudates, and, in patients withencephalopathy, papilledema (see p. 616). Changes are classified (according to the Keith, Wagener, andBarker classification) into 4 groups with increasingly worse prognosis: constriction of arterioles only(grade 1), constriction and sclerosis of arterioles (grade 2), hemorrhages and exudates in addition tovascular changes (grade 3), and papilledema (grade 4).\\nDiagnosis\\n• Multiple measurements of BP to confirm\\n• Urinalysis and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio; if abnormal, consider renal ultrasonography\\n• Blood tests: Fasting lipids, creatinine, K\\n• Renal ultrasonography if creatinine increased\\n• Evaluate for aldosteronism if K decreased\\n• ECG: If left ventricular hypertrophy, consider echocardiography\\n• Sometimes thyroid-stimulating hormone measurement\\n• Evaluate for pheochromocytoma if BP elevation sudden and labile or severe\\nHypertension is diagnosed and classified by sphygmomanometry. History, physical examination, and othertests help identify etiology and determine whether target organs are damaged.\\nBP must be measured twice—first with the patient supine or seated, then after the patient has beenstanding for ≥ 2 min—on 3 separate days. The average of these measurements is used for diagnosis.

Normal BP is much lower for infants and children.\\nIdeally, BP is measured after the patient rests > 5 min and at different times of day. A BP cuff is applied tothe upper arm. An appropriately sized cuff covers two thirds of the biceps; the bladder is long enough toencircle > 80% of the arm, and bladder width equals at least 40% of the arm\\'s circumference. Thus,obese patients require large cuffs. The health care practitioner inflates the cuff above the expectedsystolic pressure and gradually releases the air while listening over the brachial artery. The pressure atwhich the first heartbeat is heard as the pressure falls is systolic BP. Disappearance of the sound marksdiastolic BP. The same principles are followed to measure BP in a forearm (radial artery) and thigh(popliteal artery). Sphygmomanometers that contain mercury are most accurate. Mechanical devicesshould be calibrated periodically; automated readers are often inaccurate.\\nBP is measured in both arms; if BP in one arm is much higher, the higher value is used. BP is alsomeasured in a thigh (with a much larger cuff) to rule out coarctation of the aorta, particularly in patientswith diminished or delayed femoral pulses; with coarctation, BP is significantly lower in the legs. If BP is inthe low-hypertensive range or is markedly labile, more BP measurements are desirable. BPmeasurements may be sporadically high before hypertension becomes sustained; this phenomenonprobably accounts for \"white coat hypertension,\" in which BP is elevated when measured in thephysician\\'s office but normal when measured at home or by ambulatory BP monitoring. However, extremeBP elevation alternating with normal readings is unusual and possibly suggests pheochromocytoma orunacknowledged drug use.\\n[Table 208-1. JNC 7 Classification of Blood Pressure in Adults]\\nHistory: The history includes the known duration of hypertension and previously recorded levels; anyhistory or symptoms of CAD, HF, or other relevant coexisting disorders (eg, stroke, renal dysfunction,peripheral arterial disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes, gout); and a family history of any of these disorders.Social history includes exercise levels and use of tobacco, alcohol, and stimulant drugs (prescribed andillicit). A dietary history focuses on intake of salt and stimulants (eg, tea, coffee, caffeine-containingsodas, energy drinks).\\nPhysical examination: The physical examination includes measurement of height, weight, and waistcircumference; funduscopic examination (see p. 616) for retinopathy; auscultation for bruits in the neckand abdomen; and a full cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic examination. The abdomen is palpated forkidney enlargement and abdominal masses. Peripheral arterial pulses are evaluated; diminished ordelayed femoral pulses suggest aortic coarctation, particularly in patients < 30.\\nTesting: The more severe the hypertension and the younger the patient, the more extensive is theevaluation. Generally, when hypertension is newly diagnosed, routine testing to detect target-organdamage and cardiovascular risk factors is done. Tests include urinalysis, spot urine albumin:creatinineratio, blood tests (creatinine, K, Na, fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile), and ECG. Thyroid-stimulatinghormone is often measured. Ambulatory BP monitoring, renal radionuclide imaging, chest x-ray, screeningtests for pheochromocytoma, and renin-Na profiling are not routinely necessary. Peripheral plasma reninactivity is not helpful in diagnosis or drug selection.\\nDepending on results of initial tests and examination, other tests may be needed. If urinalysis detectsalbuminuria (proteinuria), cylindruria, or microhematuria or if serum creatinine is elevated (≥ 1.4 mg/dL inmen; ≥ 1.2 mg/dL in women), renal ultrasonography to evaluate kidney size may provide usefulinformation. Patients with hypokalemia unrelated to diuretic use are evaluated for primary aldosteronism(see p. 799) and high salt intake.\\nOn ECG, a broad, notched P-wave indicates atrial hypertrophy and, although nonspecific, may be one ofthe earliest signs of hypertensive heart disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy, indicated by a sustainedapical thrust and abnormal QRS voltage with or without evidence of ischemia, may occur later. If either ofthese findings is present, echocardiography is often done. In patients with an abnormal lipid profile orsymptoms of CAD, tests for other cardiovascular risk factors (eg, C-reactive protein) may be useful.\\nIf coarctation of the aorta is suspected, chest x-ray, echocardiography, CT, or MRI helps confirm the\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 208.

Systolic BP predicts fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular eventsbetter than diastolic BP. Without treatment, 1-yr survival is < 10% in patients with retinal sclerosis, cotton-wool exudates, arteriolar narrowing, and hemorrhage (grade 3 retinopathy), and < 5% in patients with thesame changes plus papilledema (grade 4 retinopathy). CAD is the most common cause of death amongtreated hypertensive patients. Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke is a common consequence of inadequatelytreated hypertension. However, effective control of hypertension prevents most complications andprolongs life.\\nGeneral Treatment\\n• Weight loss and exercise\\n• Smoking cessation\\n• Diet: Increased fruits and vegetables, decreased salt, limited alcohol\\n• Drugs if BP is initially high (> 160/100 mm Hg) or unresponsive to lifestyle modifications\\nPrimary hypertension has no cure, but some causes of secondary hypertension can be corrected. In allcases, control of BP can significantly limit adverse consequences. Despite the theoretical efficacy oftreatment, BP is lowered to the desired level in only one third of hypertensive patients in the US.\\nFor all patients, treatment aims to reduce BP to < 140/90 mm Hg; for those with a kidney disorder ordiabetes, the goal is < 130/80 mm Hg or as near this level as tolerated. Even the elderly and frail elderlycan tolerate a diastolic BP as low as 60 to 65 mm Hg well and without an increase in cardiovascularevents. Ideally, patients or family members measure BP at home, provided they have been trained to doso, they are closely monitored, and the sphygmomanometer is regularly calibrated. Treatment ofhypertension during pregnancy requires special considerations because some antihypertensive drugscan harm the fetus (see p. 2646).\\nLifestyle modifications: Recommendations include regular aerobic physical activity at least 30 min/daymost days of the week; weight loss to a body mass index of 18.5 to 24.9; smoking cessation; a diet rich infruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products with reduced saturated and total fat content; dietary sodium[Na+] of < 2.4 g/day (< 6 g NaCl); and alcohol consumption of ≤ 1 oz/day in men and ≤ 0.5 oz/day inwomen. In stage 1 (mild) hypertension with no signs of target-organ damage, lifestyle changes may makedrugs unnecessary. Patients with uncomplicated hypertension do not need to restrict their activities aslong as BP is controlled. Dietary modifications can also help control diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemias.Patients with prehypertension are encouraged to follow these lifestyle recommendations.\\nDrugs: If systolic BP remains > 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP remains > 90 mm Hg after 6 mo of lifestylemodifications, antihypertensive drugs are required. Unless hypertension is severe, drugs are usuallystarted at low doses. Drugs are initiated simultaneously with lifestyle changes for all patients withprehypertension or hypertension plus diabetes, a kidney disorder, target-organ damage, or cardiovascularrisk factors and for those with an initial BP of > 160/100 mm Hg.

Depending onthe patient's characteristics and coexisting disorders, other drugs can be used initially or added to thethiazide. Low-dose aspirin (81 mg once/day) appears to reduce incidence of cardiac events inhypertensive patients and is recommended when tolerated and not contraindicated; some evidencesuggests it is better to take the aspirin in the evening rather than in the morning—this timing appears toincrease efficacy of antihypertensive drugs.\\nSome antihypertensives are contraindicated in certain disorders (eg, β-blockers in asthma) or areindicated particularly for certain disorders (eg, β-blockers or Ca channel blockers for angina pectoris, ACEinhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers for diabetes or proteinuria—seeTables 208-2 and208-3). When a single drug is used, black men may respond best to a Ca channel blocker (eg, diltiazem).Thiazide-type diuretics appear to be particularly effective in people > 60 and in blacks.\\nIf the initial drug is ineffective or has intolerable adverse effects, another drug can be substituted. If theinitial drug is only partly effective but well tolerated, the dose can be increased or a second drug with adifferent mechanism added.\\nIf initial systolic BP is > 160 mm Hg, 2 drugs are often used. Options include combining a diuretic with a β-blocker, an ACE inhibitor, or an angiotensin II receptor blocker and combining a Ca channel blocker withan ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker. An appropriate combination and dose aredetermined; many are available as single tablets, which improve compliance (seeTable 208-4). For severe or refractory hypertension, 3 or 4 drugs may be necessary.\\nAchieving adequate control often requires several evaluations and changes in drug therapy. Reluctanceto titrate or add drugs until BP is at an acceptable level must be overcome. Lack of patient adherence,particularly because lifelong treatment is required, can interfere with adequate BP control. Education, withempathy and support, is essential for success.\\nDrugs for Hypertension\\nDiuretics: Main classes (seeTable 208-5) are thiazide-type diuretics, loop diuretics, and K-sparing diuretics. Loop diuretics are used totreat hypertension only in patients who have lost > 50% of kidney function; these diuretics are given twicedaily. Diuretics modestly reduce plasma volume and reduce vascular resistance, possibly via shifts in Nafrom intracellular to extracellular loci. These drugs are the least expensive initial therapy, and the doseneeded is small, especially for the elderly (eg, for most people > 60 hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg issufficient). Thiazide-type diuretics are most commonly used. In addition to other antihypertensive effects,they cause vasodilation as long as intravascular volume is normal. All thiazides are equally effective inequivalent doses.\\nAll diuretics except the K-sparing distal tubular diuretics cause significant K loss, so serum K is measuredevery 1 mo until the\\n[Table 208-2. Choice of Antihypertensive Drug Class]\\n[Table 208-3. Antihypertensives for High-Risk Patients]\\nlevel stabilizes. Unless serum K is normalized, K channels in the arterial walls close and the resultingvasoconstriction makes achieving the BP goal difficult. Patients with K levels < 3.5 mEq/L are given Ksupplements. Supplements may be continued long-term at a lower dose, or a K-sparing diuretic (eg, dailyspironolactone 25 to 100 mg, triamterene 50 to 150 mg, amiloride 5 to 10 mg) may be added.Supplements or addition of a K-sparing diuretic is also recommended for any patients who are also takingdigitalis, have a known heart disorder, have an abnormal ECG, have ectopy or arrhythmias, or developectopy or arrhythmias while taking a diuretic. Although the K-sparing diuretics do not cause hypokalemia,hyperuricemia, or hyperglycemia, they are not as effective as thiazide-type diurectics in controllinghypertension and thus are not used for initial treatment.

Furthermore, levels seem toincrease in only a few patients. The increase is apparent within 4 wk of treatment and can be amelioratedby a low-fat diet. The possibility of a slight increase in lipid levels does not contraindicate diuretics inhyperlipidemic patients.\\nA hereditary predisposition probably explains the few cases of gout due to diuretic-inducedhyperuricemia.

These drugs reduce BP in many hypertensive patients, regardless of plasmarenin activity.

ACE inhibitors are the least likely of the antihypertensivesto cause erectile dysfunction. ACE inhibitors are contraindicated during pregnancy. In patients with a renaldisorder, serum creatinine and K levels are monitored at least every 3 mo. Patients who have stage 3nephropathy (estimated GFR of < 60 mL/min to > 30 mL/min) and are given ACE inhibitors can usuallytolerate up to a 30 to 35% increase in serum creatinine above baseline. ACE inhibitors can cause acuterenal failure in patients who are hypovolemic or who have severe HF, severe bilateral renal arterystenosis, or severe stenosis in the artery to a solitary kidney.\\nThiazide-type diuretics enhance the antihypertensive activity of ACE inhibitors more than that of otherclasses of antihypertensives. Spironolactone and eplerenone also appear to enhance the effect of ACEinhibitors.\\nAngiotensin II receptor blockers: These drugs (see Table 208-8) block angiotensin II receptors andtherefore interfere with the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin II receptor blockers and ACE inhibitorsare equally effective as antihypertensives. Angiotensin II receptor blockers may provide added benefitsvia tissue ACE blockade. The 2 classes have the same beneficial effects in patients with left ventricularfailure or with nephropathy due to type 1 diabetes.

These 3 adrenergic blockers are not routinely recommended for initial therapy; they are used as3rd or 4th drugs if required.\\nDirect vasodilators: These drugs (including minoxidil and hydralazine—seeTable 208-10) work directly on vessels, independently of the autonomic nervous system. Minoxidil is morepotent than hydralazine but has more adverse effects, including Na and water retention andhypertrichosis, which is poorly tolerated by women. Minoxidil should be reserved for severe, refractoryhypertension. Hydralazine is used during pregnancy (eg, for preeclampsia) and as an adjunctantihypertensive. Long-term, high-dose (> 300 mg/day) hydralazine has been associated with a drug-induced lupus syndrome, which resolves when the drug is stopped.\\n[Table 208-9. Adrenergic Modifiers for Hypertension]\\n[Table 208-10. Direct Vasodilators for Hypertension]\\nRenovascular Hypertension\\nRenovascular hypertension is BP elevation due to partial or complete occlusion of one or morerenal arteries or their branches. It is usually asymptomatic unless long-standing. A bruit can beheard over one or both renal arteries in < 50% of patients. Diagnosis is by physical examinationand renal imaging with duplex ultrasonography, radionuclide imaging, or magnetic resonanceangiography. Angiography is done before definitive treatment with surgery or angioplasty.\\nRenovascular disease is one of the most common causes of curable hypertension but accounts for < 2%of all cases of hypertension. Stenosis or occlusion of one or both main renal arteries, an accessory renalartery, or any of their branches can cause hypertension by stimulating release of renin fromjuxtaglomerular cells of the affected kidney. The area of the arterial lumen must be decreased by ≥ 70%before stenosis is likely to cause hypertension. For unknown reasons, renovascular hypertension is muchless common among blacks than among whites.\\nOverall, about two thirds of cases are caused by atherosclerosis and one third by fibromusculardysplasia. Atherosclerosis is more common among men > 50 and affects mainly the proximal one third ofthe renal artery. Fibromuscular dysplasia is more common among younger patients (usually women) andusually affects the distal two third of the main renal artery and the branches of the renal arteries. Rarercauses include emboli, trauma, inadvertent ligation during surgery, and extrinsic compression of the renalpedicle by tumors.\\nRenovascular hypertension is characterized by high cardiac output and high peripheral resistance.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nRenovascular hypertension is usually asymptomatic. A systolic-diastolic bruit in the epigastrium, usuallytransmitted to one or both upper quadrants and sometimes to the back, is almost pathognomonic, but it ispresent in only about 50% of patients with fibromuscular dysplasia and is rare in patients with renalatherosclerosis.\\nRenovascular hypertension should be suspected if diastolic hypertension develops abruptly in a patient <30 or > 50; if new or previously stable hypertension rapidly worsens within 6 mo; or if hypertension isinitially very severe, associated with worsening renal function, or highly refractory to drug treatment. Ahistory of trauma to the back or flank or acute pain in this region with or without hematuria suggestsrenovascular hypertension (possibly due to arterial injury), but these historical findings are rare.Asymmetric renal size (discovered incidentally during imaging tests) and recurrent episodes ofunexplained acute pulmonary edema or heart failure also suggest it.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 208.

Sensitivity and specificity approach90% when experienced technicians do the test. It is less accurate in patients with branch stenosis.\\nMRA is a more accurate and specific noninvasive test to assess the renal arteries.\\nRadionuclide imaging is often done before and after an oral dose of captopril 50 mg. The ACE inhibitorcauses the affected artery to narrow, decreasing perfusion on the scintiscan. Narrowing also causes anincrease in serum renin, which is measured before and after captopril administration. This test may beless reliable in blacks and in patients with decreased renal function.\\nRenal angiography is done if MRA indicates a lesion amenable to angioplasty or stenting or if otherscreening tests are positive. Digital subtraction angiography with selective injection of the renal arteriescan also confirm the diagnosis, but angioplasty or stent placement cannot be done in the sameprocedure.\\nMeasurements of renal vein renin activity are sometimes misleading and, unless surgery is beingconsidered, are not necessary. However, in unilateral disease, a renal vein renin activity ratio of > 1.5(affected to unaffected side) usually predicts a good outcome with revascularization. The test is donewhen patients are depleted of Na, stimulating the release of renin.\\nTreatment\\n• Angioplasty sometimes with stent placement\\n• Rarely bypass graft\\nIf the renal vein renin activity ratio is > 1.5:1, opening the obstructed renal artery using angioplasty with orwithout a stent usually relieves hypertension. Even when the ratio is lower, revascularization or removalof the affected kidney often cures hypertension.\\nPercutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is recommended for most patients, including youngerpatients with fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal artery. Placement of a stent reduces the risk ofrestenosis; antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel) are given afterward. Saphenous vein bypass grafting isrecommended only when extensive disease in the renal artery branches makes PTA technicallyunfeasible. Sometimes complete surgical revascularization requires microvascular techniques that canonly be done ex vivo with autotransplantation of the kidney. Cure rate is 90% in appropriately selectedpatients; surgical mortality rate is < 1%. Medical treatment is always preferable to nephrectomy in youngpatients whose kidneys cannot be revascularized for technical reasons.\\nAtherosclerotic lesions respond less well to surgery and angioplasty than do lesions due to fibromusculardysplasia, presumably because patients are older and vascular disease is more extensive. Hypertensionmay persist, and surgical complications are more common. Surgical mortality rate is higher than that inyoung patients with fibromuscular dysplasia. Restenosis occurs within 2 yr after PTA in up to 50% ofpatients with renovascular atherosclerosis, especially when the lesion is located at the ostium of the renalartery, and, with stenting, in about 25%.\\nWithout treatment, the prognosis is similar to that for patients with untreated primary hypertension.Medical treatment is inadequate without intervention to alleviate the stenosis, but aggressive medical\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 208.

Diagnosis is by BP measurement,ECG, urinalysis, and serum BUN and creatinine measurements. Treatment is immediate BPreduction with IV drugs (eg, nitroprusside, β-blockers, hydralazine).\\nTarget-organ damage includes hypertensive encephalopathy, preeclampsia and eclampsia, acute leftventricular failure with pulmonary edema, myocardial ischemia, acute aortic dissection, and renal failure.Damage is rapidly progressive and often fatal.\\nHypertensive encephalopathy may involve a failure of cerebral autoregulation of blood flow. Normally, asBP increases, cerebral vessels constrict to maintain constant cerebral perfusion. Above a mean arterialpressure (MAP) of about 160 mm Hg (lower for normotensive people whose BP suddenly increases), thecerebral vessels begin to dilate rather than remain constricted. As a result, the very high BP is transmitteddirectly to the capillary bed with transudation and exudation of plasma into the brain, causing cerebraledema, including papilledema. Pathophysiology of other target-organ manifestations is discussedelsewhere in THE MANUAL.\\nAlthough many patients with stroke and intracranial hemorrhage present with elevated BP, elevated BP isoften a consequence rather than a cause of the condition. Whether rapidly lowering BP is beneficial inthese conditions is unclear; it may even be harmful.\\nHypertensive urgencies: Very high blood pressure (eg, diastolic pressure > 120 to 130 mm Hg) withouttarget-organ damage (except perhaps grades 1 to 3 retinopathy—see p. 2067) may be considered ahypertensive urgency. BP at these levels often worries the physician; however, acute complications areunlikely, so immediate BP reduction is not required. However, patients should be started on a 2-drug oralcombination (see p. 2070), and close evaluation (with evaluation of treatment efficacy) should becontinued on an outpatient basis.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nBP is elevated, often markedly (diastolic pressure > 120 mm Hg). CNS symptoms include rapidlychanging neurologic abnormalities (eg, confusion, transient cortical blindness, hemiparesis, hemisensorydefects, seizures). Cardiovascular symptoms include chest pain and dyspnea. Renal involvement may beasymptomatic, although severe azotemia due to advanced renal failure may cause lethargy or nausea.\\nPhysical examination focuses on target organs, with neurologic examination, funduscopy, andcardiovascular examination. Global cerebral deficits (eg, confusion, obtundation, coma), with or withoutfocal deficits, suggest encephalopathy; normal mental status with focal deficits suggests stroke. Severeretinopathy (sclerosis, cotton-wool spots, arteriolar narrowing, hemorrhage, papilledema) is usuallypresent with hypertensive encephalopathy, and some degree of retinopathy is present in many otherhypertensive emergencies. Jugular venous distention, basilar lung crackles, and a 3rd heart soundsuggest pulmonary edema. Asymmetry of pulses between arms suggests aortic dissection.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Very high BP\\n• Identify target-organ involvement: ECG, urinalysis, BUN, creatinine; if neurologic findings, head CT\\nTesting typically includes ECG, urinalysis, and serum BUN and creatinine. Patients with neurologicfindings require head CT to diagnose intracranial bleeding, edema, or infarction. Patients with chest painor dyspnea require chest x-ray.

Choice of drug and speed and degree of reduction vary somewhatwith the target organ involved, but generally a 20 to 25% reduction in MAP over an hour or so isappropriate, with further titration based on symptoms. Achieving \"normal\" BP urgently is not necessary.Typical first-line drugs include nitroprusside, fenoldopam, nicardipine, and labetalol (seeTable 208-11). Nitroglycerin alone is less potent.\\nOral drugs are not indicated because onset is variable and the drugs are difficult to titrate. Although short-acting oral nifedipine reduces BP rapidly, it may lead to acute cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events(sometimes fatal) and is therefore not recommended.\\nNitroprusside is a venous and arterial dilator, reducing preload and afterload; thus, it is the most useful forhypertensive patients with heart failure. It is also used for hypertensive encephalopathy and, with β-blockers, for aortic dissection. Starting dose is 0.25 to 1.0 μg/kg/min titrated in increments of 0.5 μg/kg toa maximum of 8 to 10 μg/kg/min; maximum dose is given for ≤ 10 min to minimize risk of cyanide toxicity.The drug is rapidly broken down into cyanide and nitric oxide (the active moiety). Cyanide is detoxified tothiocyanate. However, administration of > 2 μg/kg/min can lead to cyanide accumulation with toxicity tothe CNS and heart; manifestations include agitation, seizures, cardiac instability, and an anion gapmetabolic acidosis. Prolonged administration (> 1 wk or, in patients with renal insufficiency, 3 to 6 days)leads to accumulation of thiocyanate, with lethargy, tremor, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Other adverseeffects include transitory elevation of hair follicles (cutis anserina) if BP is reduced too rapidly.Thiocyanate levels should be monitored daily after 3 consecutive days of therapy, and the drug should bestopped if the serum thiocyanate level is > 12 mg/dL (> 2 mmol/L). Because the drug is broken down byultraviolet light, the IV bag and tubing are wrapped in an opaque covering.\\nFenoldopam is a peripheral dopamine-1 agonist that causes systemic and renal vasodilation andnatriuresis. Onset is rapid and half-life is brief, making it an effective alternative to nitroprusside, with theadded benefit that it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Initial dosage is 0.1 μg/kg/min IV infusion,titrated upward by 0.1 μg/kg q 15 min to a maximum of 1.6 μg/kg/min.\\nNitroglycerin is a vasodilator that affects veins more than arterioles. It can be used to managehypertension during and after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, acute MI, unstable angina pectoris,and acute pulmonary edema. IV nitroglycerin is preferable to nitroprusside for patients with severecoronary artery disease because nitroglycerin increases coronary flow, whereas nitroprusside tends todecrease coronary flow to ischemic areas, possibly because of a \"steal\" mechanism. Starting dose is 10to 20 μg/min titrated upward by 10 μg/min q 5 min to maximum antihypertensive effect. For long-term BPcontrol, nitroglycerin must be used with other drugs. The most common adverse effect is headache (inabout 2%); others include tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, apprehension, restlessness, muscular twitching,and palpitations.\\nNicardipine, a dihydropyridine Ca channel blocker with less negative inotropic effects than nifedipine, actsprimarily as a vasodilator. It is most often used for postoperative hypertension and during pregnancy.Dosage is 5 mg/h IV, increased q 15 min to a maximum of 15 mg/h. It may cause flushing, headache, andtachycardia; it can decrease GFR in patients with renal insufficiency.\\n[Table 208-11.

Arteriosclerosis\\nIntroduction\\nArteriosclerosis is a general term for several disorders that cause thickening and loss of elasticity in thearterial wall. Atherosclerosis, the most common form, is also the most serious because it causes coronaryartery disease and cerebrovascular disease. Nonatheromatous forms of arteriosclerosis includearteriolosclerosis and Monckeberg's arteriosclerosis.\\nAtherosclerosis\\nAtherosclerosis is patchy intimal plaques (atheromas) in medium-sized and large arteries; theplaques contain lipids, inflammatory cells, smooth muscle cells, and connective tissue. Riskfactors include dyslipidemia, diabetes, cigarette smoking, family history, sedentary lifestyle,obesity, and hypertension. Symptoms develop when growth or rupture of the plaque reduces orobstructs blood flow; symptoms vary by artery affected. Diagnosis is clinical and confirmed byangiography, ultrasonography, or other imaging tests. Treatment includes risk factor and dietarymodification, physical activity, antiplatelet drugs, and antiatherogenic drugs.\\nAtherosclerosis can affect all large and medium-sized arteries, including the coronary, carotid, andcerebral arteries; the aorta; its branches; and major arteries of the extremities. It is the leading cause ofmorbidity and mortality in the US and in most developed countries. In recent years, age-related mortalityattributable to atherosclerosis has been decreasing, but in 2005, cardiovascular disease, primarilycoronary and cerebrovascular atherosclerosis still caused almost 870,000 deaths in the US (more thancancer and almost 9 times more than injuries). Atherosclerosis is rapidly increasing in prevalence indeveloping countries, and as people in developed countries live longer, incidence will increase. By 2020,atherosclerosis is expected to be the leading cause of death worldwide.\\nPathophysiology\\nThe hallmark of atherosclerosis is the atherosclerotic plaque, which contains lipids (intracellular andextracellular cholesterol and phospholipids), inflammatory cells (eg, macrophages, T cells), smoothmuscle cells, connective tissue (eg, collagen, glycosaminoglycans, elastic fibers), thrombi, and Cadeposits. All stages of atherosclerosis—from initiation and growth to complication of the plaque—areconsidered an inflammatory response to injury. Endothelial injury is thought to have a primary role.\\nAtherosclerosis preferentially affects certain areas of the arterial tree. Nonlaminar or turbulent blood flow(eg, at branch points in the arterial tree) leads to endothelial dysfunction and inhibits endothelialproduction of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator and anti-inflammatory molecule. Such blood flow alsostimulates endothelial cells to produce adhesion molecules, which recruit and bind inflammatory cells.Risk factors for atherosclerosis (eg, dyslipidemia, diabetes, cigarette smoking, hypertension), oxidativestressors (eg, superoxide radicals), angiotensin II, and systemic infection and inflammation also inhibitnitric oxide production and stimulate production of adhesion molecules, proinflammatory cytokines,chemotactic proteins, and vasoconstrictors; exact mechanisms are unknown. The net effect is endothelialbinding of monocytes and T cells, migration of these cells to the subendothelial space, and initiation andperpetuation of a local vascular inflammatory response. Monocytes in the subendothelium transform intomacrophages. Lipids in the blood, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very-low-densitylipoprotein (VLDL), also bind to endothelial cells and are oxidized in the subendothelium. Uptake ofoxidized lipids and macrophage transformation into lipid-laden foam cells result in the typical earlyatherosclerotic lesions called fatty streaks. Degraded erythrocyte membranes that result from rupture ofvasa vasorum and intraplaque hemorrhage may be an important additional source of lipids withinplaques.\\nMacrophages elaborate proinflammatory cytokines that recruit smooth muscle cell migration from themedia and that further attract and stimulate growth of macrophages. Various factors promote smoothmuscle cell replication and increase production of dense extracellular matrix. The result is asubendothelial fibrous plaque with a fibrous cap, made of intimal smooth muscle cells surrounded byconnective tissue and intracellular and extracellular lipids. A process similar to bone formation causes\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 209.

Stable plaques regress, remain static, or grow slowlyover several decades until they may cause stenosis or occlusion. Unstable plaques are vulnerable tospontaneous erosion, fissure, or rupture, causing acute thrombosis, occlusion, and infarction long beforethey cause stenosis. Most clinical events result from unstable plaques, which do not appear severe onangiography; thus, plaque stabilization may be a way to reduce morbidity and mortality.\\nThe strength of the fibrous cap and its resistance to rupture depend on the relative balance of collagendeposition and degradation. Plaque rupture involves secretion of metalloproteinases, cathepsins, andcollagenases by activated macrophages in the plaque. These enzymes digest the fibrous cap, particularlyat the edges, causing the cap to thin and ultimately rupture. T cells in the plaque contribute by secretingcytokines. Cytokines inhibit smooth muscle cells from synthesizing and depositing collagen, whichnormally reinforces the plaque.\\nOnce the plaque ruptures, plaque contents are exposed to circulating blood, triggering thrombosis;macrophages also stimulate thrombosis because they contain tissue factor, which promotes thrombingeneration in vivo. One of 5 outcomes may occur:\\n• The resultant thrombus may organize and be incorporated into the plaque, changing the plaque's shapeand causing its rapid growth.\\n• The thrombus may rapidly occlude the vascular lumen and precipitate an acute ischemic event.\\n• The thrombus may embolize.\\n• The plaque may fill with blood, balloon out, and immediately occlude the artery.\\n• Plaque contents (rather than thrombus) may embolize, occluding vessels downstream.\\nPlaque stability depends on multiple factors, including plaque composition (relative proportion of lipids,inflammatory cells, smooth muscle cells, connective tissue, and thrombus), wall stress (cap fatigue), sizeand location of the core, and configuration of the plaque in relation to blood flow. By contributing to rapidgrowth and lipid deposition, intraplaque hemorrhage may play an important role in transforming stable intounstable plaques. In general, unstable coronary artery plaques have a high macrophage content, a thicklipid core, and a thin fibrous cap; they narrow the vessel lumen by < 50% and tend to ruptureunpredictably. Unstable carotid artery plaques have the same composition but typically cause problemsthrough severe stenosis and occlusion or deposition of platelet thrombi, which embolize rather thanrupture. Low-risk plaques have a thicker cap and contain fewer lipids; they often narrow the vessel lumenby > 50% and may produce predictable exercise-induced stable angina.\\nClinical consequences of plaque rupture in coronary arteries depend not only on plaque anatomy but alsoon relative balance of procoagulant and anticoagulant activity in the blood and on the vulnerability of themyocardium to arrhythmias.\\nA link between infection and atherosclerosis has been observed, specifically an association betweenserologic evidence of certain infections (eg, Chlamydia pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus) and coronaryartery disease (CAD). Putative mechanisms include indirect effects of chronic inflammation in thebloodstream, cross-reactive antibodies, and inflammatory effects of infectious pathogens on the arterialwall.\\nRisk Factors\\nThere are numerous risk factors (seeTable 209-1). Certain factors tend to cluster as the metabolic syndrome, which is becoming increasinglyprevalent. This syndrome includes abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulinresistance, a prothrombotic state, and a proinflammatory state in sedentary patients (see p. 64). Insulinresistance is not synonymous with the metabolic syndrome but may be key in its etiology.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 209.

Therole of hypertriglyceridemia in atherogenesis is complex, although it may have a small independent effect.\\nHypertension may lead to vascular inflammation via angiotensin II-mediated mechanisms. Angiotensin IIstimulates endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and macrophages to produce proatherogenicmediators, including proinflammatory cytokines, superoxide anions, prothrombotic factors, growth factors,and lectin-like oxidized LDL receptors.\\nDiabetes leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products, which increase the production ofproinflammatory cytokines from endothelial cells. Oxidative stress and reactive O2 radicals, generated indiabetes, directly injure the endothelium and promote atherogenesis.\\nTobacco smoke contains nicotine and other chemicals that are toxic to vascular endothelium. Smoking,including passive smoking, increases platelet reactivity (possibly promoting platelet thrombosis) andplasma fibrinogen levels and Hct (increasing blood viscosity). Smoking increases LDL and decreasesHDL; it also promotes vasoconstriction, which is particularly dangerous in arteries already narrowed byatherosclerosis.

High levels of lipoprotein(a) may compete with fibrin to bind with plasminogenand thus interfere with thrombolysis, predisposing to atherothrombosis.\\nA high level of small, dense LDL, characteristic of diabetes, is highly atherogenic. Mechanisms mayinclude increased susceptibility to oxidation and nonspecific endothelial binding (see p. 890).\\nA high C-reactive protein (CRP) level does not reliably predict extent of atherosclerosis but can predictincreased likelihood of ischemic events.

Patients with non-coronary atheroscleroticvascular disease have cardiac event rates comparable to those of patients with known CAD, and they arenow considered to have a CAD risk equivalent and should be treated as aggressively.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAtherosclerosis is initially asymptomatic, often for decades. Symptoms and signs develop when lesionsimpede blood flow. Transient ischemic symptoms (eg, stable exertional angina, transient ischemic attacks,intermittent claudication) may develop when stable plaques grow and reduce the arterial lumen by > 70%.Symptoms of unstable angina or infarction, ischemic stroke, or rest pain in the limbs may develop whenunstable plaques rupture and acutely occlude a major artery, with superimposition of thrombosis orembolism. Atherosclerosis may also cause sudden death without preceding stable or unstable anginapectoris.\\nAtherosclerotic involvement of the arterial wall can lead to aneurysms and arterial dissection, which canmanifest as pain, a pulsatile mass, absent pulses, or sudden death.\\nDiagnosis\\nApproach depends on the presence or absence of symptoms.\\nSymptomatic patients: Patients with symptoms and signs of ischemia are evaluated for the amount andlocation of vascular occlusion by various invasive and noninvasive tests, depending on the organinvolved (see elsewhere in THE MANUAL).

Most technologies are catheter-based; theyinclude intravascular ultrasonography (which uses an ultrasound transducer on the tip of a catheter toproduce images of the arterial lumen and wall), angioscopy, plaque thermography (to detect the increasedtemperature in plaques with active inflammation), optical coherence tomography (which uses infraredlaser light for imaging), and elastography (to identify soft, lipid-rich plaques).

Recent evidence suggests that LDL should be < 70 mg/dL (< 1.81 mmol/L) in patientswith disease or at high risk of cardiovascular events. Lifestyle changes include diet modification, smokingcessation, and regular participation in physical activity. Drugs to treat dyslipidemia, hypertension, anddiabetes are often required. These lifestyle changes and drugs directly or indirectly improve endothelialfunction, reduce inflammation, and improve clinical outcome. The statins can decrease atherosclerosis-related morbidity and mortality even when serum cholesterol is normal or slightly high. Antiplatelet drugshelp all atherosclerotic patients. Patients with CAD may benefit additionally from ACE inhibitors and β-blockers.\\nDiet: Several changes are beneficial:\\n• Less saturated fat\\n• No trans fats\\n• More fruits and vegetables\\n• More fiber\\n• Moderate (if any) alcohol\\nSubstantial decreases in saturated fat and simple carbohydrate intake and increases in fruit, vegetable,and fiber intake are recommended. These dietary changes are a prerequisite for lipid control and weightreduction and are essential for all patients.

Trans fats, which are highly atherogenic, should beavoided.\\nIncreasing carbohydrates to compensate for decreasing saturated fats in the diet increases plasmatriglyceride levels and reduces HDL levels. Thus, any caloric deficiency should be made up with proteinsand unsaturated fats rather than simple carbohydrates.

But no clinical data indicate that eatingflavonoid-rich foods or using supplements instead of foods prevents atherosclerosis.\\nIncreased fiber intake decreases total cholesterol and may have a beneficial effect on glucose and insulinlevels. Daily intake of at least 5 to 10 g of soluble fiber (eg, oat bran, beans, soy products, psyllium) isrecommended; this amount decreases LDL by about 5%. Insoluble fiber (eg, cellulose, lignin) does notappear to affect cholesterol but may confer additional health benefits (eg, reduced risk of colon cancer,possibly by stimulating bowel movement or reducing contact time with dietary carcinogens). However,excessive fiber interferes with the absorption of certain minerals and vitamins. In general, foods rich inphytochemicals and vitamins are also rich in fiber.\\nAlcohol increases HDL and has poorly defined antithrombotic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatoryproperties. These effects appear to be the same for wine, beer, and hard liquor, and occur at moderatelevels of consumption; about 30 mL (1 oz) 5 to 6 times/wk protects against coronary atherosclerosis.However, at higher doses, alcohol can cause significant health problems. Thus, the relationship betweenalcohol and total mortality rate is J-shaped; mortality rate is lowest for men who consume < 14 drinks/wkand women who consume < 9 drinks/wk.\\nThere is little evidence that dietary supplementation with vitamins, phytochemicals, and trace mineralsreduces risk of atherosclerosis. The one exception is fish oil supplements (see p. 903). Althoughalternative medicines and health foods are becoming more popular, and some may have minor effects onblood pressure or cholesterol, these treatments are not always proven safe or effective and may havenegative interactions with proven drugs. Levels of coenzyme Q10, which is necessary for the basicfunctioning of cells, tend to decrease with age and may be low in patients with certain heart and otherchronic diseases; thus, coenzyme Q10 supplementation has been used or recommended, but itstherapeutic benefit remains controversial.\\nPhysical activity: Regular physical activity (eg, 30 to 45 min of walking, running, swimming, or cycling 3to 5 times/wk) reduces incidence of some risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes), CAD (eg,MI), and death attributable to atherosclerosis in patients with and without previous ischemic events.Whether the association is causal or merely indicates that healthier people are more likely to exerciseregularly is unclear.

In about 10 to 20% of patients taking aspirin for secondary prevention, ischemic events recur.The reason may be aspirin resistance; assays to detect lack of thromboxane suppression (indicated byelevated urinary 11-dehydro thromboxane B2) are being studied for clinical use. Some evidence suggeststhat ibuprofen can interfere with aspirin's antithrombotic effect, so other NSAIDs are recommended forpatients taking aspirin for prevention. However, all NSAIDs, some more than others, including COX-2selective inhibitors (eg, rofecoxib), appear to increase cardiovascular risks.\\nClopidogrel (usually 75 mg/day) is substituted for aspirin when ischemic events recur in patients takingaspirin and in patients intolerant of aspirin. Clopidogrel in combination with aspirin is effective in treatingacute ST-segment and non-ST-segment elevation MI (see p. 2101); the combination is also given for 9 to12 mo after percutaneous intervention (PCI) to reduce risk of recurrent ischemic events.\\nTiclopidine is no longer widely used because it causes severe neutropenia in 1% of users and has severeGI adverse effects.\\nOther drugs: ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, statins, and thiazolidinediones (eg,rosiglitazone, pioglitazone) have anti-inflammatory properties that reduce risk of atherosclerosisindependent of their effects on BP, lipids, and glucose.

Statins enhance endothelial nitric oxideproduction, stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, reduce lipid accumulation in the arterial wall, and induceregression of plaques. Thiazolidinediones may control expression of proinflammatory genes, althoughrecent studies suggest that they may increase the risk of coronary events. Routine use of statins forprimary prevention of ischemic events is controversial. However, several well-controlled studies supporttheir use in high-risk patients (eg, diabetics with normal BP and lipid levels and patients with multiple riskfactors, including hyperlipidemia and/or hypertension).

The smooth muscle (media) layer atrophies, and the lumen of the affected artery widens(becomes ectatic), predisposing to aneurysm or dissection. Hypertension is a major factor in developmentof aortic arteriosclerosis and aneurysm. Intimal injury, ectasia, and ulceration may lead to thrombosis,embolism, or complete arterial occlusion.\\nArteriolosclerosis affects distal arteries in patients with diabetes or hypertension. Hyalinearteriolosclerosis affects small arteries and arterioles in patients with diabetes; typically, hyalinethickening occurs, the arteriolar wall degenerates, and the lumen narrows, causing diffuse ischemia,especially in the kidneys. Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis occurs more often in patients with hypertension;typically, laminated, concentric thickening and luminal narrowing occur, sometimes with fibrinoid depositsand vessel wall necrosis (necrotizing arteriolitis). Hypertension promotes these changes, andarteriolosclerosis, by increasing arteriolar rigidity and increasing peripheral resistance, may help sustainthe hypertension.\\nMonckeberg's arteriosclerosis (medial calcific sclerosis) affects patients > 50; age-related medialdegeneration occurs with focal calcification and even bone formation within the arterial wall. Segments ofthe artery may become a rigid calcified tube without luminal narrowing. The diagnosis is usually obviousby plain x-ray. This disorder is clinically important only because it can greatly reduce arterialcompressibility, causing extremely but falsely elevated BP readings.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 209.

Coronary Artery Disease\\nIntroduction\\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) involves impairment of blood flow through the coronary arteries,most commonly by atheromas. Clinical presentations include silent ischemia, angina pectoris,acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina, MI), and sudden cardiac death. Diagnosis is bysymptoms, ECG, stress testing, and sometimes coronary angiography. Prevention consists ofmodifying reversible risk factors (eg, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, physical inactivity,obesity, and smoking). Treatment includes drugs and procedures to reduce ischemia andrestore or improve coronary blood flow.\\nIn developed countries, CAD is the leading cause of death in both sexes, accounting for about one thirdof all deaths. Mortality rate among white men is about 1/10,000 at ages 25 to 34 and nearly 1/100 at ages55 to 64. Mortality rate among white men aged 35 to 44 is 6.1 times that among age-matched whitewomen. For unknown reasons, the sex difference is less marked in nonwhites. Mortality rate amongwomen increases after menopause and, by age 75, equals or even exceeds that of men.\\nEtiology\\nUsually, CAD is due to subintimal deposition of atheromas in large and medium-sized coronary arteries(atherosclerosis—see p. 2081). Less often, CAD is due to coronary spasm. Rare causes include coronaryartery embolism, dissection, aneurysm (eg, in Kawasaki disease), and vasculitis (eg, in SLE, syphilis).\\nPathophysiology\\nCoronary atherosclerosis is often irregularly distributed in different vessels but typically occurs at pointsof turbulence (eg, vessel bifurcations). As the atheromatous plaque grows, the arterial lumenprogressively narrows, resulting in ischemia (often causing angina pectoris). The degree of stenosisrequired to produce ischemia varies with O2 demand.\\nOccasionally, an atheromatous plaque ruptures or splits. Reasons are unclear but probably relate toplaque morphology, plaque Ca content, and plaque softening due to an inflammatory process. Ruptureexposes collagen and other thrombogenic material, which activates platelets and the coagulationcascade, resulting in an acute thrombus, which interrupts coronary blood flow and causes some degreeof myocardial ischemia. The consequences of acute ischemia, collectively referred to as acute coronarysyndromes (ACS), depend on the location and degree of obstruction and range from unstable angina totransmural infarction.\\nCoronary artery spasm is a transient, focal increase in vascular tone, markedly narrowing the lumenand reducing blood flow; symptomatic ischemia (variant angina—see p. 2098) may result. Markednarrowing can trigger thrombus formation, causing infarction or life-threatening arrhythmia. Spasm canoccur in arteries with or without atheroma. In arteries without atheroma, basal coronary artery tone isprobably increased, and response to vasoconstricting stimuli is probably exaggerated. The exactmechanism is unclear but may involve abnormalities of nitric oxide production or an imbalance betweenendothelium-derived contracting and relaxing factors. In arteries with atheroma, the atheroma may causelocal hypercontractility; proposed mechanisms include loss of sensitivity to intrinsic vasodilators (eg,acetylcholine) and increased production of vasoconstrictors (eg, angiotensin II, endothelin, leukotrienes,serotonin, thromboxane) in the area of the atheroma. Recurrent spasm may damage the intima, leading toatheroma formation. Use of vasoconstricting drugs (eg, cocaine, nicotine) and emotional stress also cantrigger coronary spasm.\\nRisk Factors\\nRisk factors for CAD are the same as those for atherosclerosis: high blood levels of low-densitylipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and lipoprotein a, low blood levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)cholesterol, diabetes mellitus (particularly type 2), smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity.

Genetic factors play a role, and severalsystemic disorders (eg, hypertension, hypothyroidism) and metabolic disorders (eg,hyperhomocysteinemia) contribute to risk. A high level of apoprotein B (apo B) is an important risk factor;it may identify increased risk when total cholesterol or LDL level is normal.\\nHigh blood levels of C-reactive protein indicate plaque instability and inflammation and may be a strongerpredictor of risk of ischemic events than high levels of LDL. High blood levels of triglycerides and insulin(reflecting insulin resistance) may be risk factors, but data are less clear. CAD risk is increased bysmoking; a diet high in fat and calories and low in phytochemicals (found in fruits and vegetables), fiber,and vitamins C and E; a diet relatively low in ω-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), at least insome people; and poor stress management.\\nAnatomy\\nThe right and left coronary arteries arise from the right and left coronary sinuses in the root of the aortajust above the aortic valve orifice. The coronary arteries divide into large and medium-sized arteries thatrun along the heart's surface (epicardial coronary arteries) and subsequently send smaller arterioles intothe myocardium. The left coronary artery begins as the left main artery and quickly divides into the leftanterior descending (LAD) and circumflex arteries. The LAD artery usually follows the anteriorinterventricular groove and, in some people, continues over the apex. This artery supplies the anteriorseptum (including the proximal conduction system) and the anterior free wall of the left ventricle (LV). Thecircumflex artery, which is usually smaller than the LAD artery, supplies the lateral LV free wall. Mostpeople have right dominance: The right coronary artery passes along the atrioventricular (AV) groove overthe right side of the heart; it supplies the sinus node (in 55%), right ventricle, and usually the AV node andinferior myocardial wall. About 10 to 15% of people have left dominance: The circumflex artery is largerand continues along the posterior AV groove to supply the posterior wall and AV node.\\nTreatment\\n• Percutaneous coronary intervention\\n• For acute thrombosis, sometimes fibrinolytic drugs\\n• Coronary artery bypass grafting\\nTreatment generally aims to reduce cardiac workload, improve coronary artery blood flow, and, over thelong term, halt and reverse the atherosclerotic process. Coronary blood flow can be improved bypercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). An acute coronarythrombosis may sometimes be dissolved by fibrinolytic drugs (see p. 2110).\\nPCI: At first, PCI was done with balloon angioplasty alone. However, roughly 50% of patients developedrestenosis within 6 mo, and 1 in 3 ultimately required repeat angioplasty or CABG. Insertion of a bare-metal stent following angioplasty reduced the rate of restenosis, but many patients still required repeattreatment. Drug-eluting stents, which secrete an antiproliferative drug (eg, sirolimus, paclitaxel) over aperiod of several weeks, have reduced the rate of restenosis to about 10%. Now, most PCI is done withstents, and about three fourths of all stents used in the US are drug-eluting stents. With the recentcontroversy over drug-eluting stents and abrupt restenosis, use of the new drug-eluting stents appears tobe decreasing in most centers. Patients with acute stenoses (ie, with unstable angina or acute MI) seemto do better with bare-metal stents. Patients without significant infarct or complications may quickly returnto work and usual activities, but strenuous activities should be avoided for 6 wk.\\nIn-stent thrombosis occurs because of the inherent thrombogenicity of metallic stents. Most cases occurwithin the first 24 to 48 h. However, late stent thrombosis, occurring after 30 days and as late as ≥ 1 yr,can occur with both bare-metal and drug-eluting stents, especially after cessation of antiplatelet therapy.Progressive endothelialization of the bare-metal stent occurs within the first few months and reduces therisk of thrombosis. However, the antiproliferative drugs secreted by drug-eluting stents inhibit this processand prolong the risk of thrombosis. Thus, patients who undergo stent placement are treated with variousantiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants (see p. 2109).

Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are no longer routinely used instable patients (ie, no comorbidities, no acute coronary syndrome) having elective stent placement.Although controversial, they may be beneficial in some patients with an acute coronary syndrome butshould not be considered routine. It is unclear whether it is beneficial to give glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitorsbefore arrival in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. After stent insertion, a HMG-CoA reductaseinhibitor (statin) is added if one is not already being used.\\nOverall risk of PCI is comparable with that for CABG. Mortality rate is 1 to 3%; MI rate is 3 to 5%. In < 3%,intimal dissection causes obstruction requiring emergency CABG.\\nCABG: CABG uses sections of autologous veins (eg, saphenous) or, preferably, arteries (eg, internalmammary, radial) to bypass diseased segments. At 1 yr, about 85% of venous bypass grafts are patent,but after 10 yr, as many as 97% of internal mammary artery grafts are patent. Arteries also hypertrophy toaccommodate increased flow.\\nCABG is typically done during cardiopulmonary bypass with the heart stopped; a bypass machine pumpsand oxygenates blood. Risks of the procedure include stroke and MI. For patients with a normal-sizedheart, no history of MI, good ventricular function, and no additional risk factors, risk is < 5% forperioperative MI, 2 to 3% for stroke, and ≤ 1% for mortality; risk increases with age and presence ofunderlying disease. Operative mortality rate is 3 to 5 times higher for a second bypass than for the first;thus, timing of the first bypass should be optimal.\\nAfter cardiopulmonary bypass, about 25 to 30% of patients develop cognitive dysfunction, possiblycaused by microemboli originating in the bypass machine. Dysfunction ranges from mild to severe andmay persist for weeks to years. To minimize this risk, some centers use a beating heart technique (ie, nocardiopulmonary bypass), in which a device mechanically stabilizes the part of the heart upon which thesurgeon is working.\\nCAD may progress despite bypass surgery. Postoperatively, the rate of proximal obstruction of bypassedvessels increases. Vein grafts become obstructed early if thrombi form and later (several years) ifatherosclerosis causes slow degeneration of the intima and media. Aspirin prolongs vein graft patency.Continued smoking has a profound adverse effect on patency.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention of CAD involves modifying atherosclerosis risk factors (see p. 2084): smoking cessation,weight loss, a healthful diet, regular exercise, modification of serum lipid levels, and control ofhypertension and diabetes. Antihypertensives should be used to achieve a goal blood pressure of <130/80 mm Hg. Modification of serum lipid levels (particularly with statins) may slow or even partiallyreverse the progression of CAD. LDL targets are < 100 mg/dL (< 2.59 mmol/L) for patients with knownCAD or 70 to 80 mg/dL (1.81 to 2.07 mmol/L) for those with a history of an ischemic event. Nicotinic acidor a fibrate should be added for patients with an HDL < 40 mg/dL (< 1.03 mmol/L).\\nAngina Pectoris\\nAngina pectoris is a clinical syndrome of precordial discomfort or pressure due to transientmyocardial ischemia without infarction.

Acute coronary thrombosis can cause angina if obstruction is partial ortransient, but it usually causes MI.\\nBecause myocardial O2 demand is determined mainly by heart rate, systolic wall tension, and contractility,narrowing of a coronary artery typically results in angina that occurs during exertion and is relieved byrest.\\nIn addition to exertion, cardiac workload can be increased by disorders such as hypertension, aorticstenosis, aortic regurgitation, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In such cases, angina can result whetheratherosclerosis is present or not. These disorders can also decrease relative myocardial perfusionbecause myocardial mass is increased (causing decreased diastolic flow).\\nA decreased O2 supply, as in severe anemia or hypoxia, can precipitate or aggravate angina.\\nPathophysiology\\nIn stable angina, the relationship between workload or demand and ischemia is usually relativelypredictable. However, atherosclerotic arterial narrowing is not entirely fixed; it varies with the normalfluctuations in arterial tone that occur in all people. Thus, more people have angina in the morning, whenarterial tone is relatively high. Also, abnormal endothelial function may contribute to variations in arterialtone; eg, in endothelium damaged by atheromas, stress of a catecholamine surge causesvasoconstriction rather than dilation (normal response).\\nAs the myocardium becomes ischemic, coronary sinus blood pH falls, cellular K is lost, lactateaccumulates, ECG abnormalities appear, and ventricular function deteriorates. Left ventricular (LV)diastolic pressure usually increases during angina, sometimes inducing pulmonary congestion anddyspnea. The exact mechanism by which ischemia causes discomfort is unclear but may involve nervestimulation by hypoxic metabolites.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAngina may be a vague, barely troublesome ache or may rapidly become a severe, intense precordialcrushing sensation. It is rarely described as pain. Discomfort is most commonly felt beneath the sternum,although location varies. Discomfort may radiate to the left shoulder and down the inside of the left arm,even to the fingers; straight through to the back; into the throat, jaws, and teeth; and, occasionally, downthe inside of the right arm. It may also be felt in the upper abdomen. The discomfort of angina is neverabove the ears or below the umbilicus.\\nSome patients have atypical angina (eg, bloating, gas, abdominal distress), often ascribing symptoms toindigestion; belching may even seem to relieve the symptoms. Others have dyspnea due to the sharp,reversible increase in LV filling pressure that often accompanies ischemia. Frequently, the patient'sdescription is imprecise, and whether the problem is angina, dyspnea, or both may be difficult todetermine. Because ischemic symptoms require a minute or more to resolve, brief, fleeting sensationsrarely represent angina.\\nBetween and even during attacks of angina, physical findings may be normal. However, during the attack,heart rate may increase modestly, BP is often elevated, heart sounds become more distant, and the apicalimpulse is more diffuse. The 2nd heart sound may become paradoxical because LV ejection is moreprolonged during an ischemic attack. A 4th heart sound is common, and a 3rd heart sound may develop. Amid or late systolic apical murmur shrill—or blowing but not especially loud—may occur if ischemiacauses localized papillary muscle dysfunction, causing mitral regurgitation.\\nAngina pectoris is typically triggered by exertion or strong emotion, usually persists no more than a fewminutes, and subsides with rest. Response to exertion is usually predictable, but in some patients,exercise that is tolerated one day may precipitate angina the next because of variations in arterial tone.Symptoms are exaggerated when exertion follows a meal or occurs in cold weather; walking into the windor first contact with cold air after leaving a warm room may precipitate an attack. Symptom severity isoften classified by the degree of exertion resulting in angina (see\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 210.

Canadian Cardiovascular Classification System of Angina Pectoris]\\nAttacks may vary from several a day to symptom-free intervals of weeks, months, or years. They mayincrease in frequency (called crescendo angina) to a fatal outcome or gradually decrease or disappear ifadequate collateral coronary circulation develops, if the ischemic area infarcts, or if heart failure orintermittent claudication supervenes and limits activity.\\nNocturnal angina may occur if a dream causes striking changes in respiration, pulse rate, and BP.Nocturnal angina may also be a sign of recurrent LV failure, an equivalent of nocturnal dyspnea. Therecumbent position increases venous return, stretching the myocardium and increasing wall stress, whichincreases O2 demand.\\nAngina may occur spontaneously during rest (called angina decubitus). It is usually accompanied by amodestly increased heart rate and a sometimes markedly higher BP, which increase O2 demand. Theseincreases may be the cause of rest angina or the result of ischemia induced by plaque rupture andthrombus formation. If angina is not relieved, unmet myocardial O2 demand increases further, making MImore likely.\\nUnstable angina: Because angina characteristics are usually predictable for a given patient, anychanges (ie, rest angina, new-onset angina, increasing angina) should be considered serious. Suchchanges are termed unstable angina and require prompt evaluation and treatment.\\nUnstable angina is classified based on severity and clinical situation (seeTable 210-2). Also considered are whether unstable angina occurs during treatment for chronic stableangina and whether transient changes in ST-T waves occur during angina. If angina has occurred within48 h and no contributory extracardiac condition is present, troponin levels may be measured to helpestimate prognosis; troponin-negative indicates a better prognosis than troponin-positive.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Typical symptoms\\n• ECG\\n• Stress testing with ECG or imaging (echocardiographic or nuclear)\\n• Coronary angiography for significant symptoms or positive stress test\\nDiagnosis is suspected if chest discomfort is typical and is precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest.Patients whose chest discomfort lasts > 20 min or occurs during rest or who have syncope or heart failureare evaluated for an acute coronary syndrome (see p. 2099). Chest discomfort may also be caused by GIdisorders (eg, reflux, esophageal spasm, indigestion, cholelithiasis), costochondritis, anxiety, panicattacks, hyperventilation, and other cardiac disorders (eg, pericarditis, mitral valve prolapse,supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation), even when coronary blood flow is not compromised (see p.2025).\\nECG: If typical exertional symptoms are present, ECG is indicated. Because angina resolves quickly withrest, ECG rarely can be done during an attack except during stress testing. If done during an attack, ECGis likely to show reversible ischemic changes: T wave discordant to the QRS vector, ST-segmentdepression (typically), ST-segment elevation, decreased R-wave height, intraventricular or bundle branchconduction disturbances, and arrhythmia (usually ventricular extrasystoles). Between attacks, the ECG(and usually LV function) at rest is normal\\n[Table 210-2. Braunwald Classification of Unstable Angina*]\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 210.

In the remaining 70%, the ECG shows evidence of previous infarction, hypertrophy, ornonspecific ST-segment and T-wave (ST-T) abnormalities. An abnormal resting ECG alone does notestablish or refute the diagnosis.\\nStress testing: More specific tests include stress testing with ECG or with myocardial imaging (eg,echocardiography, radionuclide imaging) and coronary angiography. Further testing is needed to confirmthe diagnosis, evaluate disease severity, determine appropriate exercise levels for the patient, and helppredict prognosis.\\nNoninvasive tests are considered first. For coronary artery disease (CAD), the most accurate are stressechocardiography and myocardial perfusion imaging with single-photon emission CT (SPECT) or PET.However, these tests are more expensive than simple stress testing with ECG.\\nIf a patient has a normal resting ECG and can exercise, exercise stress testing with ECG is done. In menwith chest discomfort suggesting angina, stress ECG testing has a specificity of 70%; sensitivity is 90%.Sensitivity is similar in women, but specificity is lower, particularly in women < 55 (< 70%). However,women are more likely than men to have an abnormal resting ECG when CAD is present (32% vs 23%).Although sensitivity is reasonably high, exercise ECG can miss severe CAD (even left main or 3-vesseldisease). In patients with atypical symptoms, a negative stress ECG usually rules out angina pectoris andCAD; a positive result may or may not represent coronary ischemia and indicates need for further testing.\\nWhen the resting ECG is abnormal, false-positive ST-segment shifts are common on the stress ECG, sopatients should have stress testing with myocardial imaging. Exercise or pharmacologic stress (eg, withdobutamine or dipyridamole infusion) may be used. The choice of imaging technique depends oninstitutional availability and expertise. Imaging tests can help assess LV function and response to stress;identify areas of ischemia, infarction, and viable tissue; and determine the site and extent of myocardiumat risk. Stress echocardiography can also detect ischemia-induced mitral regurgitation.\\nAngiography: Coronary angiography (see also p.2049) is the standard for diagnosing CAD but is not always necessary to confirm the diagnosis. It isindicated primarily to locate and assess severity of coronary artery lesions when revascularization(percutaneous intervention [PCI] or coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) is being considered.Angiography may also be indicated when knowledge of coronary anatomy is necessary to advise aboutwork or lifestyle needs (eg, discontinuing job or sports activities). Obstruction is assumed to bephysiologically significant when the luminal diameter is reduced > 70%. This reduction correlates wellwith the presence of angina pectoris unless spasm or thrombosis is superimposed.\\nIntravascular ultrasonography provides images of coronary artery structure. An ultrasound probe on thetip of a catheter is inserted in the coronary arteries during angiography. This test can provide moreinformation about coronary anatomy than other tests; it is indicated when the nature of lesions is unclearor when apparent disease severity does not match symptom severity. Used with angioplasty, it can helpensure optimal placement of stents.\\nImaging: Electron beam CT can detect the amount of Ca present in coronary artery plaque. The Cascore (from 1 to 100) is roughly proportional to the risk of subsequent coronary events. However,because Ca may be present in the absence of significant stenosis, the score does not correlate well withthe need for angioplasty or CABG. Thus, the American Heart Association recommends that screening withelectron beam CT should be done only for select groups of patients and is most valuable when combinedwith historical and clinical data to estimate risk of death or nonfatal MI. These groups may includeasymptomatic patients with an intermediate Framingham 10-yr risk estimate of 10 to 20% andsymptomatic patients with equivocal stress test results.\\nMultidetector row CT (MDRCT) coronary angiography can accurately identify coronary stenosis and hasa number of advantages. The test is noninvasive, can exclude coronary stenosis with high accuracy, canestablish stent or bypass graft patency, can visualize cardiac and coronary venous anatomy, and canassess calcified and noncalcified plaque burden.

It may beused to evaluate CAD by several techniques, which enable direct visualization of coronary stenosis,assessment of flow in the coronary arteries, evaluation of myocardial perfusion and metabolism,evaluation of wall motion abnormalities during stress, and assessment of infracted myocardium vs viablemyocardium.\\nCurrent indications for cardiac MRI include evaluation of cardiac structure and function, assessment ofmyocardial viability, and possibly diagnosis and risk assessment of patients with either known orsuspected CAD.\\nPrognosis\\nThe main adverse outcomes are unstable angina, MI, and sudden death due to arrhythmias. Annualmortality rate is about 1.4% in patients with angina, no history of MI, a normal resting ECG, and normalBP. However, women with CAD tend to have a worse prognosis. Mortality rate is about 7.5% whensystolic hypertension is present, 8.4% when the ECG is abnormal, and 12% when both are present. Type2 diabetes about doubles the mortality rate for each scenario.\\nPrognosis worsens with increasing age, increasingly severe anginal symptoms, presence of anatomiclesions, and poor ventricular function. Lesions in the left main coronary artery or proximal left anteriordescending artery indicate particularly high risk. Although prognosis correlates with number and severityof coronary arteries affected, prognosis is surprisingly good for patients with stable angina, even thosewith 3-vessel disease, if ventricular function is normal.\\nTreatment\\n• Modification of risk factors (smoking, BP, lipids)\\n• Antiplatelet drugs (aspirin plus clopidogrel)\\n• β-Blockers\\n• Nitroglycerin and Ca channel blockers for symptom control\\n• Revascularization if symptoms persist despite medical therapy\\n• ACE inhibitors and statins\\nReversible risk factors are modified as much as possible (see also p. 2084). Smokers should stopsmoking; ≥ 2 yr after stopping smoking, risk of MI is reduced to that of people who never smoked.Hypertension is treated diligently because even mild hypertension increases cardiac workload. Weightloss alone often reduces the severity of angina. Sometimes treatment of mild LV failure markedly lessensangina. Paradoxically, digitalis occasionally intensifies angina, presumably because increased myocardialcontractility increases O2 demand, arterial tone is increased, or both. Aggressive reduction of total andLDL cholesterol (via diet plus drugs as necessary) slows the progression of CAD, may cause somelesions to regress (see p. 896), and improves endothelial function and thus arterial response to stress.

For an acute attack, sublingual nitroglycerin is the mosteffective drug.\\nTo prevent ischemia, all patients diagnosed with CAD or at high risk of developing CAD should take anantiplatelet drug daily. β-Blockers, unless contraindicated or not tolerated, are given to most patients. Forsome patients, prevention of symptoms requires Ca channel blockers or long-acting nitrates.\\nAntiplatelet drugs inhibit platelet aggregation. Aspirin binds irreversibly to platelets and inhibitscyclooxygenase and platelet aggregation. Clopidogrel blocks adenosine diphosphate-induced plateletaggregation. Either drug can reduce risk of ischemic events (MI, sudden death), but the drugs are mosteffective when given together. Patients unable to tolerate one should receive the other drug alone.\\nβ-Blockers limit symptoms and prevent infarction and sudden death better than other drugs. β-Blockersblock sympathetic stimulation of the heart and reduce systolic BP, heart rate, contractility, and cardiacoutput, thus decreasing myocardial O2 demand and increasing exercise tolerance. They also increasethe threshold for ventricular fibrillation. Most patients tolerate these drugs well. Many β-blockers areavailable and effective. Dose is titrated upward as needed until limited by bradycardia or adverse effects.Patients who cannot tolerate β-blockers are given a Ca channel blocker with negative chronotropiceffects (eg, diltiazem, verapamil). Those at risk of β-blocker intolerance (eg, those with asthma) may betried on a cardioselective β-blocker (eg, carvedilol), perhaps with pulmonary function testing before andafter drug administration to detect drug-induced bronchospasm.\\nNitroglycerin is a potent smooth-muscle relaxant and vasodilator. Its main sites of action are in theperipheral vascular tree, especially in the venous or capacitance system, and in coronary blood vessels.Even severely atherosclerotic vessels may dilate in areas without atheroma. Nitroglycerin lowers systolicBP and dilates systemic veins, thus reducing myocardial wall tension, a major determinant of myocardialO2 need. Sublingual nitroglycerin is given for an acute attack or for prevention before exertion. Dramaticrelief usually occurs within 1.5 to 3 min, is complete by about 5 min, and lasts up to 30 min. The dose maybe repeated every 4 to 5 min up to 3 times if relief is incomplete. Patients should always carrynitroglycerin tablets or aerosol spray to use promptly at the onset of an angina attack. Patients shouldstore tablets in a tightly sealed, light-resistant glass container, so that potency is not lost. Because thedrug deteriorates quickly, small amounts should be obtained frequently.\\nLong-acting nitrates (oral or transdermal) are used if symptoms persist after the β-blocker dose ismaximized. If angina occurs at predictable times, a nitrate is given to cover those times. Oral nitratesinclude isosorbide dinitrate and mononitrate (the active metabolite of the dinitrate). They are effectivewithin 1 to 2 h; their effect lasts 4 to 6 h. Sustained-release formulations of isosorbide mononitrate appearto be effective throughout the day. For transdermal use, cutaneous nitroglycerin patches have largelyreplaced nitroglycerin ointments primarily because ointments are inconvenient and messy. Patches slowlyrelease the drug for a prolonged effect; exercise capacity improves 4 h after patch application and wanesin 18 to 24 h. Nitrate tolerance may occur, especially when plasma concentrations are kept constant.Because MI risk is highest in early morning, an afternoon or early evening respite period from nitrates isreasonable unless a patient commonly has angina at that time. For nitroglycerin, an 8- to 10-h respiteperiod seems sufficient. Isosorbide may require a 12-h respite period. If given once/day, sustained-release isosorbide mononitrate does not appear to elicit tolerance.\\nCa channel blockers may be used if symptoms persist despite use of nitrates or if nitrates are nottolerated. Ca channel blockers are particularly useful if hypertension or coronary spasm is also present.Different types of Ca channel blockers have different effects. Dihydropyridines (eg, nifedipine,amlodipine, felodipine) have no chronotropic effects and vary substantially in their negative inotropiceffects. Shorter-acting dihydropyridines may cause reflex tachycardia and are associated with increasedmortality in CAD patients; they should not be used to treat stable angina.\\n[Table 210-3.

They can be used alone in patients with β-blocker intoleranceor asthma and normal LV systolic function but may increase cardiovascular mortality in patients with LVsystolic dysfunction.\\nRevascularization: Revascularization, either with PCI (eg, angioplasty, stenting) or CABG should beconsidered if angina persists despite drug therapy and worsens quality of life or if anatomic lesions(noted during angiography) put a patient at high risk of mortality. The choice between PCI and CABGdepends on extent and location of anatomic lesions, the experience of the surgeon and medical center,and, to some extent, patient preference.\\nPCI is usually preferred for 1- or 2-vessel disease with suitable anatomic lesions. Lesions that are long ornear bifurcation points are often not amenable to PCI. However, as stent technology improves, PCI isbeing used for more complicated cases.\\nCABG is very effective in selected patients with angina. The ideal candidate has severe angina pectorisand localized disease, or diabetes mellitus. About 85% of patients have complete or dramatic symptomrelief. Exercise stress testing shows positive correlation between graft patency and improved exercisetolerance, but exercise tolerance sometimes remains improved despite graft closure.\\nCABG improves survival for patients with left main disease, those with 3-vessel disease and poor LVfunction, and some patients with 2-vessel disease. However, for patients with mild or moderate angina(class I or II) or 3-vessel disease and good ventricular function, CABG appears to only marginally improvesurvival. For patients with 1-vessel disease, outcomes with drug therapy, PCI, and CABG are similar;exceptions are left main disease and proximal left anterior descending disease, for whichrevascularization appears advantageous.\\nVariant Angina\\nVariant angina is angina pectoris secondary to epicardial coronary artery spasm (Prinzmetal'sangina).\\nMost patients with variant angina have significant fixed proximal obstruction of at least one majorcoronary artery. Spasm usually occurs within 1 cm of the obstruction (often accompanied by ventriculararrhythmia).\\nSymptoms are anginal discomfort occurring mainly during rest, often at night, and only rarely andinconsistently during exertion (unless significant coronary artery obstruction is also present). Attacks tendto occur regularly at certain times of day.\\nDiagnosis is suspected if ST-segment elevation occurs during the attack. Between anginal attacks, theECG may be normal or show a stable abnormal pattern. Confirmation is by provocative testing withergonovine or acetylcholine, which may precipitate coronary artery spasm, identified by significant ST-segment elevation or by observation of a reversible spasm during cardiac catheterization. Testing is donemost commonly in a cardiac catheterization laboratory and occasionally in a coronary care unit.\\nAverage survival at 5 yr is 89 to 97%, but mortality risk is greater for patients with both variant angina andatherosclerotic coronary artery obstruction. Usually, sublingual nitroglycerin promptly relieves variantangina. Ca channel blockers may effectively prevent symptoms. Theoretically, β-blockers may exacerbatespasm by allowing unopposed α-adrenergic vasoconstriction, but this effect has not been provedclinically. Oral drugs most commonly used are sustained-release diltiazem 120 to 540 mg once/day,sustained-release verapamil 120 to 480 mg once/day (dose must be reduced in patients with renal orhepatic dysfunction), or amlodipine 15 to 20 mg once/day (dose must be reduced in elderly patients andpatients with hepatic dysfunction). In refractory cases, amiodarone may be useful. Although these drugsrelieve symptoms, they do not appear to alter prognosis.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 210.

Some of these patients haveischemia detected during stress testing; others do not. In some patients, the cause of ischemia seems tobe reflex intramyocardial coronary constriction and reduced coronary flow reserve. Other patients havemicrovascular dysfunction within the myocardium: The abnormal vessels do not dilate in response toexercise or other cardiovascular stressors; sensitivity to cardiac pain may also be increased. Prognosis isgood, although symptoms of ischemia may recur for years. In many patients, β-blockers relievesymptoms. This disorder should not be confused with variant angina due to epicardial coronary spasm orwith another disorder called syndrome X, which refers to the metabolic syndrome (see p. 64).\\nSilent Ischemia\\nPatients with CAD (particularly diabetics) may have ischemia without symptoms. Ischemia is evidenced bytransient asymptomatic ST-T abnormalities seen during 24-h Holter monitoring. Radionuclide studies cansometimes document asymptomatic myocardial ischemia during physical or mental stress (eg, mentalarithmetic). Silent ischemia and angina pectoris may coexist, occurring at different times. Prognosisdepends on severity of CAD.\\nAcute Coronary Syndromes\\n(Unstable Angina; Acute MI)\\nAcute coronary syndromes (ACS) result from acute obstruction of a coronary artery.Consequences depend on degree and location of obstruction and range from unstable angina tonon-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI), ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI), and sudden cardiacdeath. Symptoms are similar in each of these syndromes (except sudden death) and includechest discomfort with or without dyspnea, nausea, and diaphoresis. Diagnosis is by ECG andthe presence or absence of serologic markers. Treatment is antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants,nitrates, β-blockers, and, for STEMI, emergency reperfusion via fibrinolytic drugs, percutaneousintervention, or, occasionally, coronary artery bypass graft surgery.\\nIn the US, about 1.5 million MIs occur annually. MI results in death for 400,000 to 500,000 people, withabout half dying before they reach the hospital (see Cardiac Arrest on p. 2255).\\nEtiology\\nThese syndromes usually occur when an acute thrombus forms in an atherosclerotic coronary artery.Atheromatous plaque sometimes becomes unstable or inflamed, causing it to rupture or split, exposingthrombogenic material, which activates platelets and the coagulation cascade and produces an acutethrombus. Platelet activation involves a conformational change in membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIareceptors, allowing cross-linking (and thus aggregation) of platelets. Even atheromas causing minimalobstruction can rupture and result in thrombosis; in > 50% of cases, stenosis is < 40%. The resultantthrombus abruptly interferes with blood flow to parts of the myocardium. Spontaneous thrombolysisoccurs in about two thirds of patients; 24 h later, thrombotic obstruction is found in only about 30%.However, in virtually all cases, obstruction lasts long enough to cause tissue necrosis.\\nRarely, these syndromes are caused by arterial embolism (eg, in mitral or aortic stenosis, infectiveendocarditis, or marantic endocarditis). Cocaine use and other causes of coronary spasm can sometimesresult in MI. Spasm-induced MI may occur in normal or atherosclerotic coronary arteries.\\nPathophysiology\\nInitial consequences vary with size, location, and duration of obstruction and range from transient\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 210.

Measurement of newer, more sensitive markers indicates that some cell necrosisprobably occurs even in mild forms; thus, ischemic events occur on a continuum, and classification intosubgroups, although useful, is somewhat arbitrary. Sequelae of the acute event depend primarily on themass and type of cardiac tissue infarcted.\\nMyocardial dysfunction: Ischemic (but not infarcted) tissue has impaired contractility, resulting inhypokinetic or akinetic segments; these segments may expand or bulge during systole (called paradoxicalmotion). The size of the affected area determines effects, which range from minimal to mild heart failure tocardiogenic shock. Some degree of heart failure occurs in about two thirds of hospitalized patients withacute MI. It is termed ischemic cardiomyopathy if low cardiac output and heart failure persist. Ischemiainvolving the papillary muscle may lead to mitral valve regurgitation.\\nMI: MI is myocardial necrosis resulting from abrupt reduction in coronary blood flow to part of themyocardium. Infarcted tissue is permanently dysfunctional; however, there is a zone of potentiallyreversible ischemia adjacent to infarcted tissue.\\nMI affects predominantly the left ventricle (LV), but damage may extend into the right ventricle (RV) or theatria. RV infarction usually results from obstruction of the right coronary or a dominant left circumflexartery; it is characterized by high RV filling pressure, often with severe tricuspid regurgitation and reducedcardiac output. An inferoposterior infarction causes some degree of RV dysfunction in about half ofpatients and causes hemodynamic abnormality in 10 to 15%. RV dysfunction should be considered in anypatient who has inferoposterior infarction and elevated jugular venous pressure with hypotension orshock. RV infarction complicating LV infarction may significantly increase mortality risk.\\nAnterior infarcts tend to be larger and result in a worse prognosis than inferoposterior infarcts. They areusually due to left coronary artery obstruction, especially in the anterior descending artery; inferoposteriorinfarcts reflect right coronary or dominant left circumflex artery obstruction.\\nTransmural infarcts involve the whole thickness of myocardium from epicardium to endocardium and areusually characterized by abnormal Q waves on ECG. Nontransmural or subendocardial infarcts do notextend through the ventricular wall and cause only ST-segment and T-wave (ST-T) abnormalities.Subendocardial infarcts usually involve the inner one third of myocardium, where wall tension is highestand myocardial blood flow is most vulnerable to circulatory changes. These infarcts may follow prolongedhypotension. Because the transmural depth of necrosis cannot be precisely determined clinically, infarctsare usually classified by the presence or absence of ST-segment elevation or Q waves on the ECG.Volume of myocardium destroyed can be roughly estimated by the extent and duration of CK elevation.\\nElectrical dysfunction: Ischemic and necrotic cells are incapable of normal electrical activity, resulting invarious ECG changes (predominantly ST-T abnormalities), arrhythmias, and conduction disturbances.ST-T abnormalities of ischemia include ST-segment depression (often downsloping from the J point), T-wave inversion, ST-segment elevation (often referred to as injury current), and peaked T waves in thehyperacute phase of infarction. Conduction disturbances can reflect damage to the sinus node, theatrioventricular (AV) node, or specialized conduction tissues. Most changes are transient; some arepermanent.\\nClassification\\nClassification is based on ECG changes and presence or absence of cardiac markers in blood.Distinguishing NSTEMI and STEMI is useful because prognosis and treatment are different.\\nUnstable angina (acute coronary insufficiency, preinfarction angina, intermediate syndrome) is definedas:\\n• Rest angina that is prolonged (usually > 20 min)\\n• New-onset angina of at least class III severity in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS)classification (see Table 210-1)\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 210.

Of cardiac markers, CK is not elevated but troponin I or Tmay be slightly increased. Unstable angina is clinically unstable and often a prelude to MI or arrhythmiasor, less commonly, to sudden death.\\nNon-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI, subendocardial MI) is myocardial necrosis (evidenced bycardiac markers in blood; troponin I or T and CK will be elevated) without acute ST-segment elevation orQ waves. ECG changes such as ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, or both may be present.\\nST-segment elevation MI (STEMI, transmural MI) is myocardial necrosis with ECG changes showingST-segment elevation that is not quickly reversed by nitroglycerin or showing new left bundle branchblock. Q waves may be present. Both troponin and CK are elevated.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSymptoms of ACS depend somewhat on the extent and location of obstruction and are quite variable.Except when infarction is massive, recognizing the amount of ischemia by symptoms alone is difficult.\\nAfter the acute event, many complications can occur. They usually involve electrical dysfunction (eg,conduction defects, arrhythmias), myocardial dysfunction (eg, heart failure, interventricular septum or freewall rupture, ventricular aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, mural thrombus formation, cardiogenic shock), orvalvular dysfunction (typically mitral regurgitation). Electrical dysfunction can be significant in any form ofACS, but usually, large parts of myocardium must be ischemic to cause significant myocardial dysfunction.Other complications of ACS include recurrent ischemia and pericarditis. Pericarditis that occurs 2 to 10 wkafter an MI is known as post-MI syndrome or Dressler's syndrome.\\nUnstable angina: Symptoms are those of angina pectoris (see p. 2090), except that the pain ordiscomfort of unstable angina usually is more intense, lasts longer, is precipitated by less exertion, occursspontaneously at rest (as angina decubitus), is progressive (crescendo) in nature, or involves anycombination of these features.\\nNSTEMI and STEMI: Symptoms of NSTEMI and STEMI are the same. Days to weeks before the event,about two thirds of patients experience prodromal symptoms, including unstable or crescendo angina,shortness of breath, and fatigue. Usually, the first symptom of infarction is deep, substernal, visceral paindescribed as aching or pressure, often radiating to the back, jaw, left arm, right arm, shoulders, or all ofthese areas. The pain is similar to angina pectoris but is usually more severe and long-lasting; more oftenaccompanied by dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting; and relieved little or only temporarily byrest or nitroglycerin. However, discomfort may be mild; about 20% of acute MIs are silent (ie,asymptomatic or causing vague symptoms not recognized as illness by the patient), more commonly indiabetics. Some patients present with syncope. Patients often interpret their discomfort as indigestion,particularly because spontaneous relief may be falsely attributed to belching or antacid consumption.Women are more likely to present with atypical chest discomfort. Elderly patients may report dyspneamore than ischemic-type chest pain. In severe ischemic episodes, the patient often has significant painand feels restless and apprehensive. Nausea and vomiting may occur, especially with inferior MI.Dyspnea and weakness due to LV failure, pulmonary edema, shock, or significant arrhythmia maydominate.\\nSkin may be pale, cool, and diaphoretic. Peripheral or central cyanosis may be present. Pulse may bethready, and BP is variable, although many patients initially have some degree of hypertension duringpain.\\nHeart sounds are usually somewhat distant; a 4th heart sound is almost universally present.

Pain must be differentiated from the pain of pneumonia,pulmonary embolism, pericarditis, rib fracture, costochondral separation, esophageal spasm, acute aorticdissection, renal calculus, splenic infarction, or various abdominal disorders. In patients with previouslydiagnosed hiatus hernia, peptic ulcer, or a gallbladder disorder, the clinician must be wary of attributingnew symptoms to these disorders.\\nThe approach is the same when any ACS is suspected: initial and serial ECG and serial cardiac markermeasurements, which distinguish among unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI. Every emergencydepartment should have a triage system to immediately identify patients with chest pain for rapidassessment and ECG. Pulse oximetry and chest x-ray (particularly to look for mediastinal widening, whichsuggests aortic dissection) is also done.\\nECG: ECG is the most important test and should be done within 10 min of presentation. It is the center ofthe decision pathway because fibrinolytics benefit patients with STEMI but may increase risk for thosewith NSTEMI. Also, urgent cardiac catheterization is indicated for patients with acute STEMI but not forthose with NSTEMI.\\nFor STEMI, initial ECG is usually diagnostic, showing ST-segment elevation ≥ 1 mm in 2 or more\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 210.

The ECG must be read carefully because ST-segment elevation may be subtle, particularly in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF); sometimes the reader'sattention is mistakenly focused on leads with ST-segment depression. If symptoms are characteristic, ST-segment elevation on ECG has a specificity of 90% and a sensitivity of 45% for diagnosing MI. Serialtracings (obtained every 8 h for 1 day, then daily) showing a gradual evolution toward a stable, morenormal pattern or development of abnormal Q waves over a few days tends to confirm the diagnosis.\\nBecause nontransmural (non-Q-wave) infarcts are usually in the subendocardial or midmyocardial layers,they do not produce diagnostic Q waves or distinct ST-segment elevation on the ECG. Instead, theycommonly produce only varying degrees of ST-T abnormalities that are less striking, variable, ornonspecific and sometimes difficult to interpret (NSTEMI). If such abnormalities resolve (or worsen) onrepeat ECGs, ischemia is very likely. However, when repeat ECGs are unchanged, acute MI is unlikelyand, if still suspected clinically, requires other evidence to make the diagnosis. A normal ECG taken whena patient is pain free does not rule out unstable angina; a normal ECG taken during pain, although it doesnot rule out angina, suggests that the pain is not ischemic.\\nIf RV infarction is suspected, a 15-lead ECG is usually recorded; additional leads are placed at V4R, and,to detect posterior infarction, V8 and V9.\\nECG diagnosis of MI is more difficult when a left bundle branch block configuration is present because itresembles STEMI changes. ST-segment elevation concordant with the QRS complex strongly suggestsMI as does > 5-mm ST-segment elevation in at least 2 precordial leads. But generally, any patient withsuggestive symptoms and new-onset (or not known to be old) left bundle branch block is treated as forSTEMI.\\nCardiac markers: Cardiac markers are cardiac enzymes (eg, CK-MB) and cell contents (eg, troponin I,troponin T, myoglobin) that are released into the bloodstream after myocardial cell necrosis. The markersappear at different times after injury and decrease at different rates (seeFig. 210-7).\\nUsually, several different markers are measured at regular intervals, typically every 6 to 8 h for 1 day.Newer bedside tests, which are more convenient, can be just as sensitive when done at shorter intervals(eg, time 0, 1, 3, and 6 h after presentation).\\nTroponins are most specific for MI but can also be elevated by ischemia without infarction; elevated levels(actual number varies with assay used) are considered diagnostic. Borderline elevated troponin levels inpatients with unstable angina indicate increased risk of adverse events and thus the need for furtherevaluation and treatment. False-positives sometimes occur in heart failure and renal failure. CK-MB isslightly less specific. False-positives occur in renal failure, hypothyroidism, and skeletal muscle injury.Myoglobin is not specific for MI but, because it increases earlier than other markers, may be an earlywarning sign to assist in triage of patients with nondiagnostic ECGs.\\nCoronary angiography: Coronary angiography most often combines diagnosis with percutaneouscoronary intervention (PCI, ie, angioplasty, stenting). Angiography is obtained urgently for patients withSTEMI, patients with persistent chest pain despite maximal medical therapy, and patients withcomplications (eg, markedly elevated cardiac markers, presence of cardiogenic shock, acute mitralregurgitation, ventricular septal\\n[Fig. 210-7.

Some experts alsorecommend that angiography be done before hospital discharge in STEMI patients with inducibleischemia on stress imaging or an ejection fraction < 40%.\\nOther tests: Routine laboratory tests are nondiagnostic but, if obtained, show non-specific abnormalitiescompatible with tissue necrosis (eg, increased ESR, moderately elevated WBC count with a shift to theleft). A fasting lipid profile should be obtained within the first 24 h for all patients hospitalized with ACS.\\nMyocardial imaging (see also p. 2058) is not needed to make the diagnosis if cardiac markers or ECG ispositive. However, in patients with MI, bedside echocardiography is invaluable for detecting mechanicalcomplications. Before or shortly after discharge, patients with symptoms suggesting an ACS butnondiagnostic ECGs and normal cardiac markers should have a stress imaging test (radionuclide orechocardiographic imaging with pharmacologic or exercise stress). Imaging abnormalities in such patientsindicate increased risk of complications in the next 3 to 6 mo.\\nRight heart catheterization using a balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter (see p. 2244) can be used tomeasure right heart, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressures and cardiac output. Thistest is usually done only if patients have significant complications (eg, severe heart failure, hypoxia,hypotension).\\nPrognosis\\nUnstable angina: About 30% of patients with unstable angina have an MI within 3 mo of onset; suddendeath is less common. Marked ECG changes with chest pain indicate higher risk of subsequent MI ordeath.\\nNSTEMI and STEMI: Overall mortality rate is about 30%, with 50 to 60% of these patients dying beforereaching the hospital (typically due to ventricular fibrillation). Inhospital mortality rate is about 10%(typically due to cardiogenic shock) but varies significantly with severity of LV failure (seeTable 210-4).\\nMost patients who die of cardiogenic shock have an infarct or a combination of scar and new infarctaffecting ≥ 50% of LV mass. Five clinical characteristics predict 90% of the mortality in patients whopresent with STEMI (seeTable 210-5): older age (31% of\\n[Table 210-4.

Mortality rate of diabetics and women tends to be higher.\\nMortality rate of patients who survive initial hospitalization is 8 to 10% in the year after acute MI. Mostfatalities occur in the first 3 to 4 mo. Persistent ventricular arrhythmia, heart failure, poor ventricularfunction, and recurrent ischemia indicate high risk. Many authorities recommend stress ECG beforehospital discharge or within 6 wk. Good exercise performance without ECG abnormalities is associatedwith a favorable prognosis; further evaluation is usually not required. Poor exercise performance isassociated with a poor prognosis.\\nCardiac performance after recovery depends largely on how much functioning myocardium survives theacute attack.

An ACS is a medical emergency; outcome isgreatly influenced by rapid diagnosis and treatment.\\nTreatment occurs simultaneously with diagnosis. A reliable IV route must be established, O2 given(typically 2 L by nasal cannula), and continuous single-lead ECG monitoring started. Prehospitalinterventions by ambulance personnel (including ECG, chewed aspirin (325 mg), early thrombolysis whenindicated and possible, and triage to the appropriate hospital) can reduce risk of mortality andcomplications. Early diagnostic data and response to treatment can help determine the need for andtiming of revascularization (see p.2111).\\nBedside cardiac marker tests can help identify low-risk patients with a suspected ACS (eg, those withinitially negative cardiac markers and nondiagnostic ECGs), who can be managed in 24-h observationunits or chest pain centers. Higher-risk patients should be admitted to a monitored inpatient unit orcoronary care unit (CCU). Several validated tools can help stratify risk. Thrombolysis in MI (TIMI) riskscores may be the most widely used (see Tables 210-5 and210-6).\\nPatients with suspected NSTEMI and intermediate or high risk should be admitted to an inpatient careunit. Those with STEMI should be admitted to a CCU.\\nOnly heart rate and rhythm recorded by single-lead ECG are consistently useful for routine, continuousmonitoring. However, some clinicians recommend routine multilead monitoring with continuous ST-segment recording to identify transient, recurrent ST-segment elevations or depressions. Such findings,even in patients without symptoms, suggest ischemia and identify higher-risk patients who may requiremore aggressive evaluation and treatment.\\nQualified nurses can interpret the ECG for arrhythmia and initiate protocols for its treatment. All staffmembers should know how to do CPR.\\n[Table 210-5. Mortality Risk at 30 Days in Stemi]\\nContributing disorders (eg, anemia, heart failure) are aggressively treated.\\nThe care unit should be a quiet, calm, restful area. Single rooms are preferred; privacy consistent withmonitoring should be ensured. Usually, visitors and telephone calls are restricted to family membersduring the first few days.

After the acute phase of illness, the most important tasks are often management of depression,rehabilitation, and institution of long-term preventive programs. Overemphasis on bed rest, inactivity, andthe seriousness of the disorder reinforces anxiety and depressive tendencies, so patients are encouragedto sit up, get out of bed, and engage in appropriate activities as soon as possible. The effects of thedisorder, prognosis, and individualized rehabilitation program should be explained to the patient.\\nMaintaining normal bowel function with stool softeners (eg, docusate) to prevent straining is important.Urinary retention is common among elderly patients, especially after several days of bed rest or ifatropine was given.

Hypotension and bradycardia secondary to morphine can usually be overcomeby prompt elevation of the lower extremities. Nitroglycerin is initially given sublingually, followed bycontinuous IV drip if needed.\\nBP is normal or slightly elevated in most patients on arrival at the emergency department; BP graduallyfalls over the next several hours. Continued hypertension requires treatment with antihypertensives,preferably IV nitroglycerin, to lower BP and reduce cardiac workload. Severe hypotension or other signsof shock are ominous and must be treated aggressively with IV fluids and sometimes vasopressors (seep. 2296).\\nAntiplatelet drugs: Aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are examples. All patientsare given aspirin 160 to 325 mg (not enteric-coated), if not contraindicated, at presentation and 81 mgonce/day indefinitely thereafter. Chewing the first dose before swallowing quickens absorption. Aspirinreduces short- and long-term mortality risk. If aspirin cannot be taken, clopidogrel 75 mg once/day orticlopidine 250 mg bid may be used. Clopidogrel has largely replaced ticlopidine for routine use becauseneutropenia is a risk with ticlopidine and the WBC count must be monitored regularly. Patients withunstable angina or NSTEMI in whom intervention is not possible or recommended are given both aspirinand clopidogrel for at least 1 mo. The optimal duration of double antiplatelet therapy for these patients isthe subject of ongoing investigation.\\nIn patients undergoing PCI, a clopidogrel loading dose (300 to 600 mg po once) improves outcomes,particularly when administered 24 h in advance. However, delaying PCI for 24 h is not appropriate formany patients. Further, such a loading dose increases risk of perioperative bleeding in patients whorequire coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) because their coronary anatomy proves unfavorable forPCI. Thus, many clinicians administer a clopidogrel loading dose only in the catheterization laboratoryonce coronary anatomy and lesions have been proven to be amenable to PCI.\\nFor patients receiving a stent for revascularization, aspirin is continued indefinitely, and clopidogrel shouldbe used for at least 1 mo in patients with a bare-metal stent. Patients with a drug-eluting stent have aprolonged risk of thrombosis and may benefit from 12 mo of clopidogrel treatment, although therecommended duration is still unclear.\\nGP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (abciximab, tirofiban, eptifibatide) are potent antiplatelet drugs that must be given IV.Although there is some controversy, evidence indicates that patients with ACS undergoing PCI maybenefit from a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor; results appear to be better if the drug is initiated at least 6 h before PCIand continued for 18 to 24 h thereafter. If PCI is not being done, some clinicians give a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitorto all high-risk patients (eg, those with markedly elevated cardiac markers, a TIMI risk score ≥ 4, orpersistent symptoms despite adequate drug therapy). The GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor is continued for 24 to 36 h,and angiography is done before the infusion period is over. GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are not recommended forpatients receiving fibrinolytics. Abciximab, tirofiban, and eptifibatide appear to have equivalent efficacy,and the choice of drug should depend on other factors (eg, cost, availability, familiarity).\\nAnticoagulant drugs: Either a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), unfractionated heparin, orbivalirudin is given routinely to patients with ACS unless contraindicated (eg, by active bleeding orplanned use of streptokinase or anistreplase). Choice of agent is somewhat involved.\\nUnfractionated heparin is more complicated to use because it requires frequent (q 6 h) dosingadjustments to achieve an activated PTT (aPTT) 1.5 to 2 times the control value. In patients undergoingangiography, further dosing adjustment is done to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) of 200 to 250sec if the patient is treated with a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor and 250 to 300 sec if a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor is notbeing given. However, the effects of unfractionated heparin are shorter and can be reversed (with promptdiscontinuation of heparin infusion and with administration of protamine sulfate) if bleeding developsfollowing catheterization.\\nThe LMWHs have better bioavailability, are given by simple weight-based dose without monitoring aPTTand dose titration, and have lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. They also may produce anincremental benefit in outcomes relative to unfractionated heparin in patients with ACS. Of the LMWHs,\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 210.

However, enoxaparin may pose a higherbleeding risk in patients with STEMI who are > 75, and its effects are not completely reversible withprotamine.\\nThus, taking all into account, many published guidelines recommend LMWH (eg, enoxaparin) overunfractionated heparin in patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI and in patients < 75 with STEMI whoare not undergoing PCI. By contrast, unfractionated heparin is recommended when emergency PCI isdone (eg, patients with acute STEMI who proceed to the catheterization laboratory), when CABG isindicated within the next 24 h, and when patients are at high risk of bleeding complications (eg, history ofGI bleeding within the last 6 mo) or have creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min. Ongoing studies should helpclarify the choice between LMWH and unfractionated heparin.\\nBivalirudin is an acceptable anticoagulant for patients undergoing primary PCI who are at high risk ofbleeding and is recommended for those with a known or suspected history of heparin-inducedthrombocytopenia. For patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI, dose is an initial bolus of 0.1 mg/kg IVfollowed by a drip of 0.25 mg/kg/h. For patients with STEMI, initial dose is 0.75 mg/kg IV followed by 1.75mg/kg/h.\\nFor patients undergoing PCI, postprocedure heparin is no longer recommended unless patients are athigh risk of thromboembolic events (eg, those with large anterior MI, known LV thrombus, atrialfibrillation), because postprocedure ischemic events have decreased with the use of stents andantiplatelet drugs. For patients not undergoing PCI, heparin is continued for 48 h (or longer if symptomspersist).\\nThe difficulties with the heparins (including bleeding complications, the possibility of heparin-inducedthrombocytopenia, and, with unfractionated heparin, the need for dosing adjustments) have led to thesearch for better anticoagulants. The direct thrombin inhibitors, bivalirudin and argatroban, may have alower incidence of serious bleeding and improved outcomes, particularly in patients with renalinsufficiency (hirudin, another direct thrombin inhibitor, appears to cause more bleeding than the otherdrugs). The factor Xa inhibitor, fondaparinux, reduces mortality and reinfarction in patients with NSTEMIwho undergo PCI without increasing bleeding but may result in worse outcomes than unfractionatedheparin in patients with STEMI. Although routine use of these alternative anticoagulants is thus notcurrently recommended, they should be used in place of unfractionated heparin or LMWH in patients witha known or suspected history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.\\nPatients at high risk of systemic emboli also require long-term therapy with oral warfarin. Conversion towarfarin should begin 48 h after symptom resolution or PCI.\\nβ-Blockers: These drugs are recommended unless contraindicated (eg, by bradycardia, heart block,hypotension, or asthma), especially for high-risk patients. β-Blockers reduce heart rate, arterial pressure,and contractility, thereby reducing cardiac workload and O2 demand. IV β-blockers given within the firstfew hours improve prognosis by reducing infarct size, recurrence rate, incidence of ventricular fibrillation,and mortality risk. Infarct size largely determines cardiac performance after recovery.\\nHeart rate and BP must be carefully monitored during treatment with β-blockers. Dosage is reduced ifbradycardia or hypotension develops. Excessive adverse effects may be reversed by infusion of the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol 1 to 5 μg/min.\\nNitrates: A short-acting nitrate, nitroglycerin, is used to reduce cardiac workload in selected patients.Nitroglycerin dilates veins, arteries, and arterioles, reducing LV preload and afterload. As a result,myocardial O2 demand is reduced, lessening ischemia. IV nitroglycerin is recommended during the first24 to 48 h for patients with heart failure, large anterior MI, persistent chest discomfort, or hypertension.BP can be reduced by 10 to 20 mm Hg but not to < 80 to 90 mm Hg systolic. Longer use may benefitpatients with recurrent chest pain or persistent pulmonary congestion. In high-risk patients, nitroglyceringiven in the first few hours reduces infarct size and short-term and possibly long-term mortality risk.Nitroglycerin is not routinely given to low-risk patients with uncomplicated MI.\\nFibrinolytics: Tenecteplase (TNK), alteplase (rTPA), reteplase (rPA), streptokinase, and anistreplase\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 210.

Theyconvert single chain plasminogen to double-chain plasminogen, which has fibrinolytic activity. They havedifferent characteristics and dosing regimens (see Table 210-7) and are appropriate only for selectedpatients with STEMI (see p.2113).\\nTenecteplase and reteplase are recommended most often because of their simplicity of administration;tenecteplase is given as a single bolus over 5 sec and reteplase as a double bolus 30 min apart.Administration time and drug errors are reduced compared with other fibrinolytics. Tenecteplase, likealteplase, has an intermediate risk of intracranial hemorrhage, has a higher rate of recanalization thanother fibrinolytics, and is expensive. Reteplase has the highest risk of intracranial hemorrhage and arecanalization rate similar to that of tenecteplase, and it is expensive.\\nStreptokinase may induce allergic reactions, especially if it has been used previously, and must be givenby infusion over 30 to 60 min; however, it has a low incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage and isrelatively inexpensive. Anistreplase, related to streptokinase, is similarly allergenic and slightly moreexpensive but can be given as a single bolus. Neither drug requires concomitant heparin use. For both,recanalization rate is lower than that with other plasminogen activators. Because of the possibility ofallergic reactions, patients who previously received streptokinase or anistreplase are not given that drug.\\n[Table 210-7. IV Fibrinolytic Drugs Available in the US]\\nAlteplase is given in an accelerated or front-loaded dosage over 90 min. Alteplase with concomitant IVheparin improves patency, is nonallergenic, has a higher recanalization rate than other fibrinolytics, and isexpensive.\\nOther drugs: ACE inhibitors appear to reduce mortality risk in MI patients, especially in those withanterior infarction, heart failure, or tachycardia. The greatest benefit occurs in the highest-risk patientsearly during convalescence. ACE inhibitors are given > 24 h after thrombolysis stabilization and, becauseof continued beneficial effect, may be prescribed long-term.\\nAngiotensin II receptor blockers may be an effective alternative for patients who cannot tolerate ACEinhibitors (eg, because of cough). Currently, they are not first-line treatment after MI. Contraindicationsinclude hypotension, renal failure, bilateral renal artery stenosis, and known allergy.\\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have long been used for prevention of coronary artery diseaseand ACS, but there is now increasing evidence that they also have short-term benefits, such as stabilizingplaque, reversing endothelial dysfunction, decreasing thrombogenicity, and reducing inflammation. Thus,all patients without contraindications to therapy should receive a statin as early as possible followingACS. LDL levels of 70 to 80 mg/dL (1.81 to 2.07 mmol/L) are the recommended ultimate target.\\nRevascularization Modalities and Indications\\nRevascularization is the restoration of blood supply to ischemic myocardium in an effort to limit ongoingdamage, reduce ventricular irritability, and improve short-term and long-term outcomes. Modes ofrevascularization include thrombolysis with fibrinolytic drugs, PCI with or without stent placement, andCABG.\\nThe use, timing, and modality of revascularization depend on which ACS is present, timing ofpresentation, extent and location of anatomic lesions, and availability of personnel and facilities (seeFig. 210-8).\\nUnstable angina and NSTEMI: Immediate reperfusion is not as urgent in patients with uncomplicatedNSTEMI (in whom a completely occluded infarct-related artery at presentation is uncommon) or in thosewith unstable angina who respond to medical therapy.

A noninterventional approach and a trial of medical management are usedfor those in whom angiography demonstrates only a small area of myocardium at risk, lesion morphologynot amenable to PCI, anatomically insignificant disease (< 50% coronary stenosis), or significant left maindisease in patients who are candidates for CABG. Further, angiography or PCI should be deferred infavor of medical management for patients with a high risk of procedure-related morbidity or mortality.\\nBy contrast, patients with persistent chest pain despite maximal medical therapy or complications (eg,markedly elevated cardiac markers, presence of cardiogenic shock, acute mitral regurgitation, ventricularseptal defect, unstable arrhythmias) should proceed directly to the cardiac catheterization laboratory toidentify coronary lesions requiring PCI or CABG.\\nAs in patients with stable angina, CABG is generally preferred over PCI for patients with left main or leftmain equivalent disease, for those with 3- or 2-vessel disease involving the left anterior descendingartery, and for those with left ventricular dysfunction or diabetes. CABG must also be considered whenPCI is unsuccessful, cannot be used (eg, in lesions that are long or near bifurcation points), or causesacute coronary artery dissection.\\nFibrinolytics are not indicated for unstable angina or NSTEMI. Risk outweighs potential benefit.\\nSTEMI: Emergency PCI is the preferred treatment of STEMI when available in a timely fashion (door toballoon-inflation time < 90 min) by an experienced operator. Indications for urgent PCI later in the courseof STEMI include hemodynamic instability, malignant arrhythmias requiring transvenous pacing orrepeated cardioversion, and age > 75. If the lesions necessitate CABG, there is about 4 to 12% mortalityand a 20 to 43% morbidity rate.\\nIf there is likely to be a significant delay in availability of PCI, thrombolysis should be done for STEMIpatients meeting criteria (see Table 210-8). Reperfusion using fibrinolytics is most effective if given in thefirst few minutes to hours after onset of MI. The earlier a fibrinolytic is begun, the better. The goal is adoor-to-needle time of 30 to 60 min. Greatest benefit occurs within 3 h, but the drugs may be effective upto 12 h. Used with aspirin, fibrinolytics reduce hospital mortality rate by 30 to 50% and improve ventricularfunction. Although controversial, prehospital use of fibrinolytics by trained paramedics can significantlyreduce time to treatment and should be considered in situations in which PCI within 90 min is notpossible, particularly in patients presenting within 3 h of symptom onset.\\n[Table 210-8. Fibrinolytic Therapy for Stemi]\\nRegardless, most patients who undergo thrombolysis will ultimately require transfer to a PCI-capablefacility for elective angiography and PCI as necessary prior to discharge. PCI should be considered afterfibrinolytics if chest pain or ST-segment elevation persists ≥ 60 min after initiation of fibrinolytics or if painand ST-segment elevation recur, but only if PCI can be initiated < 90 min after onset of recurrence. If PCIis unavailable, fibrinolytics can be repeated.\\nCharacteristics and selection of fibrinolytic drugs are discussed on p. 2110.\\nComplications\\nElectrical dysfunction occurs in > 90% of MI patients (see also p. 2142). Electrical dysfunction thatcommonly causes mortality in the first 72 h includes tachycardia (from any focus) rapid enough to reducecardiac output and lower BP, Mobitz type II block (2nd degree) or complete (3rd degree) AV block,ventricular tachycardia (VT), and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Asystole is uncommon, except as a terminalmanifestation of progressive LV failure and shock. Patients with disturbances of cardiac rhythm arechecked for hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities, which can be causative or contributory.\\nSinus node disturbances: If the artery supplying the sinus node is affected, sinus node disturbancescan occur; they are more likely if there is a preexisting sinus node disorder (common among the elderly).Sinus bradycardia, the most common sinus node disturbance, is usually not treated unless there ishypotension or the heart rate is < 50 beats/min.

For bradycardia with hypotension (which may reducemyocardial perfusion), atropine sulfate 0.5 to 1 mg IV is used; it can be repeated after several minutes ifresponse is inadequate. Several small doses are best because high doses may induce tachycardia.Occasionally, a temporary transvenous pacemaker must be inserted.\\nPersistent sinus tachycardia is usually ominous, often reflecting LV failure and low cardiac output. Withoutheart failure or another evident cause, this arrhythmia may respond to a β-blocker, given po or IVdepending on degree of urgency.\\nAtrial arrhythmias: Atrial arrhythmias (atrial ectopic beats, atrial fibrillation [AF], and, less commonly,atrial flutter) occur in about 10% of MI patients and may reflect LV failure or right atrial infarction.Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia is uncommon and usually occurs in patients who have had previousepisodes of it. Atrial ectopy is usually benign but if frequency increases, causes, particularly heart failure,are sought. Frequent atrial ectopic beats may respond to a β-blocker.\\nAF is usually transient if it occurs within the first 24 h. Risk factors include age > 70, heart failure,previous history of MI, large anterior infarction, atrial infarction, pericarditis, hypokalemia,hypomagnesemia, a chronic lung disorder, and hypoxia. Fibrinolytics reduce incidence. Recurrentparoxysmal AF is a poor prognostic sign and increases risk of systemic emboli.\\nFor AF, heparin is usually used because systemic emboli are a risk (see p.2165). IV β-blockers (eg, atenolol 2.5 to 5.0 mg over 2 min to total dose of 10 mg in 10 to 15 min,metoprolol 2 to 5 mg q 2 to 5 min to a total dose of 15 mg in 10 to 15 min) slow the ventricular rate. Heartrate and BP are closely monitored. Treatment is withheld when ventricular rate decreases satisfactorily orsystolic BP is < 100 mm Hg. IV digoxin, which is not as effective as β-blockers, is used cautiously andonly in patients with AF and LV systolic dysfunction. Usually, digoxin takes at least 2 h to effectively slowheart rate and may rarely aggravate ischemia in patients with recent ACS. For patients without evident LVsystolic dysfunction or conduction delay manifested by a wide QRS complex, IV verapamil or IV diltiazemmay be considered. Diltiazem may be given as an IV infusion to control heart rate for long periods.\\nIf AF compromises circulatory status (eg, causing LV failure, hypotension, or chest pain), urgent electricalcardioversion is done. If AF returns after cardioversion, IV amiodarone should be considered.\\nFor atrial flutter, rate is controlled as for AF, but heparin is not required. Low-energy direct current (DC)cardioversion will terminate atrial flutter.\\nConduction defects: Mobitz type I block (Wenckebach block, progressive prolongation of PR interval) isrelatively common with an inferior-diaphragmatic infarction; it is usually self-limited and rarely progressesto higher grade block. Mobitz type II block (dropped beats) usually indicates massive anterior MI, as doescomplete heart block with wide QRS complexes (atrial impulses do not reach the ventricle); both areuncommon. Frequency of complete (3rd degree) AV block depends on site of infarction. Complete AVblock occurs in 5 to 10% of patients with inferior infarction and is usually transient. It occurs in < 5% withuncomplicated anterior infarction but in up to 26% of those with right bundle branch block and leftposterior hemiblock.\\nMobitz type I block usually does not warrant treatment. For true Mobitz type II block with dropped beats orfor AV block with slow, wide QRS complexes, temporary transvenous pacing is the treatment of choice.External pacing can be used until a temporary transvenous pacemaker can be placed. Althoughisoproterenol infusion may restore rhythm and rate temporarily, it is not used because it increases O2demand and risk of rhythm abnormalities. Atropine 0.5 mg IV q 3 to 5 min to a total dose of 2.5 mg may beuseful for narrow-complex AV block with a slow ventricular rate but is not recommended for new wide-complex AV block.\\nVentricular arrhythmias: These arrhythmias are common and may result from hypoxia, electrolyteimbalance (hypokalemia, possibly hypomagnesemia), or sympathetic overactivity in ischemic cellsadjacent to infarcted tissue (which is not electrically active). Treatable causes of ventricular arrhythmiasare sought and corrected. Serum K should be kept above 4.0 mEq/L. IV KCl is recommended; usually, 10mEq/h can be infused, but for severe hypokalemia (K < 2.5 mEq/L), 20 to 40 mEq/h can be infused\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 210.

Polymorphic VT, sustained(≥ 30 sec) monomorphic VT, or any VT with symptoms of instability (eg, heart failure, hypotension, chestpain) is treated with synchronized cardioversion. VT without hemodynamic instability may be treated withIV lidocaine, procainamide, or amiodarone. Some clinicians also treat complex ventricular arrhythmias withMg sulfate 2 g IV over 5 min whether or not serum Mg is low. VT may occur months after MI. Late VT ismore likely to occur in patients with transmural infarction and to be sustained.\\nVF occurs in 5 to 12% of patients during the first 24 h after MI, usually within 6 h. Late VF usuallyindicates continued or recurrent myocardial ischemia and, when accompanied by hemodynamicdeterioration, is a poor prognostic sign. VF is treated with immediate unsynchronized cardioversion (seep. 2262).\\nAn IV β-blocker early in MI followed by continued oral β-blockers reduces the incidence of ventriculararrhythmias (including VF) and mortality in patients who do not have heart failure or hypotension.Prophylaxis with other drugs (eg, lidocaine) increases mortality risk and is not recommended.\\nAfter the acute phase, the presence of complex ventricular arrhythmias or nonsustained VT, especiallywith significant LV systolic dysfunction, increases mortality risk. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator(ICD) should be considered. Programmed endocardial stimulation can help select the most effectiveantiarrhythmics or determine the need for an ICD. Before treatment with an antiarrhythmic or ICD,coronary angiography and other tests are done to look for recurrent myocardial ischemia, which mayrequire PCI or CABG.\\nHeart failure: Patients with large infarctions (determined by ECG or serum markers) and those withmechanical complications, hypertension, or diastolic dysfunction are more likely to develop heart failure.Clinical findings depend on infarct size, elevation of LV filling pressure, and degree of reduction in cardiacoutput. Dyspnea, inspiratory rales at the lung bases, and hypoxemia are common.\\nTreatment depends on severity. For mild cases, a loop diuretic (eg, furosemide 20 to 40 mg IV once/dayor bid) to reduce ventricular filling pressure is often sufficient. For severe cases, vasodilators (eg, IVnitroglycerin) are often used to reduce preload and afterload; during treatment, pulmonary arteryocclusion pressure is often measured via right heart (Swan-Ganz) catheterization. ACE inhibitors are usedas long as systolic BP remains > 100 mm Hg. A short-acting ACE inhibitor given in low doses (eg,captopril 3.125 to 6.25 mg po q 4 to 6 h, increasing doses as tolerated) is best for initial treatment. Oncethe maximum dose is reached (maximum for captopril, 50 mg tid), a longer-acting ACE inhibitor (eg,fosinopril, lisinopril, ramipril) is substituted for the long-term. If heart failure remains in New York HeartAssociation class II or worse (seeTable 211-2 on p. 2124), an aldosterone inhibitor (eg, eplerenone, spironolactone) should be added. Forsevere heart failure, an intraarterial counterpulsation balloon pump may provide temporary hemodynamicsupport. When revascularization or surgical repair is not feasible, heart transplantation is considered.Long-term LV or biventricular implantable assist devices may be used as a bridge to transplantation; iftransplantation is impossible, the LV assist device is occasionally used as permanent treatment.Occasionally, use of such a device results in recovery and can be removed in 3 to 6 mo.\\nIf heart failure causes hypoxemia, O2 is given by nasal prongs (to maintain PaO2 at about 100 mg Hg). Itmay help oxygenate myocardium and limit the ischemic zone.\\nPapillary muscle disorders: Functional papillary muscle insufficiency occurs in about 35% of patientsduring the first few hours of infarction. Papillary muscle ischemia causes incomplete coaptation of themitral valve leaflets, which is transient in most patients. But in some patients, papillary muscle or free wallscarring causes permanent mitral regurgitation. Functional papillary muscle insufficiency is characterizedby an apical late systolic murmur and typically resolves without treatment.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 210.

It produces acute, severe mitral regurgitation. Papillary muscle rupture is characterized by thesudden appearance of a loud apical holosystolic murmur and thrill, usually with pulmonary edema.Occasionally, when severe regurgitation is silent but suspected clinically, echocardiography is done. Mitralvalve repair or replacement is effective.\\nMyocardial rupture: Interventricular septum or free wall rupture occurs in 1% of patients with acute MI. Itcauses 15% of hospital mortality.\\nInterventricular septum rupture, although rare, is 8 to 10 times more common than papillary musclerupture. Intraventricular septum rupture is characterized by the sudden appearance of a loud systolicmurmur and thrill medial to the apex along the left sternal border in the 3rd or 4th intercostal space,accompanied by hypotension with or without signs of LV failure. Diagnosis may be confirmed using aballoon-tipped catheter and comparing blood O2 saturation or PO2 of right atrial, RV, and pulmonaryartery samples. A significant increase in RV PO2 is diagnostic, as is Doppler echocardiography, whichmay demonstrate the actual shunt of blood across the ventricular septum. Treatment is surgery, whichshould be delayed for up to 6 wk after MI so that infarcted myocardium can heal maximally; ifhemodynamic instability persists, earlier surgery is indicated despite a high mortality risk.\\nFree wall rupture increases in incidence with age and is more common among women. It is characterizedby sudden loss of arterial pressure with momentary persistence of sinus rhythm and often by signs ofcardiac tamponade. Surgery is rarely successful. Rupture of a free wall is almost always fatal.\\nVentricular aneurysm: A localized bulge in the ventricular wall, usually the LV wall, can occur at the siteof a large infarction. Ventricular aneurysms are common, especially with a large transmural infarct (usuallyanterior). Aneurysms may develop in a few days, weeks, or months. They are unlikely to rupture but maylead to recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, low cardiac output, and mural thrombosis with systemicembolism. A ventricular aneurysm may be suspected when paradoxical precordial movements are seen orfelt. ECG shows persistent ST-segment elevation, and chest x-ray shows a characteristic bulge of thecardiac shadow. Echocardiography is done to confirm the diagnosis and determine whether a thrombus ispresent. Surgical excision may be indicated when LV failure or arrhythmia persists. Use of ACE inhibitorsduring acute MI modifies LV remodeling and may reduce the incidence of aneurysm.\\nPseudoaneurysm is incomplete rupture of the free LV wall; it is limited by the pericardium.Pseudoaneurysms almost always contain a thrombus and often rupture completely. They are repairedsurgically.\\nHypotension and cardiogenic shock: Hypotension may be due to decreased ventricular filling or lossof contractile force secondary to massive MI. Marked hypotension (eg, systolic BP < 90 mm Hg) withtachycardia and symptoms of end-organ hypoperfusion (reduced urine output, mental confusion,diaphoresis, cold extremities) is termed cardiogenic shock (see also p. 2294). Pulmonary congestiondevelops rapidly in cardiogenic shock.\\nDecreased LV filling is most often caused by reduced venous return secondary to hypovolemia, especiallyin patients receiving intensive loop diuretic therapy, but it may reflect RV infarction. Marked pulmonarycongestion suggests loss of LV contractile force (LV failure) as the cause. Treatment depends on thecause. In some patients, determining the cause requires use of a pulmonary artery catheter to measureintracardiac pressures. If pulmonary artery occlusion pressure is < 18 mm Hg, decreased filling, usuallydue to hypovolemia, is likely; if pressure is > 18 mm Hg, LV failure is likely. For hypotension due tohypovolemia, cautious fluid replacement with 0.9% saline is usually possible without left heart overload(excessive rise in left atrial pressure). However, sometimes LV function is so compromised that adequatefluid replacement sharply increases pulmonary artery occlusion pressure to levels associated withpulmonary edema (> 25 mm Hg). If left atrial pressure is high, hypotension is probably due to LV failure,and if diuretics are ineffective, inotropic therapy or circulatory support may be required.\\nIn cardiogenic shock, an α- or β-agonist may be temporarily effective. Dopamine, a catecholamine with αand β1 effects, is given at 0.5 to 1 μg/kg/min, increased until response is satisfactory or dose is about 10μg/kg/min.

It often causes or exacerbateshypotension; it is most effective when hypotension is secondary to low cardiac output with increasedperipheral vascular resistance. Dopamine may be more effective than dobutamine when a vasopressoreffect is also required. In refractory cases, dobutamine and dopamine may be combined. An intraaorticcounterpulsation balloon pump can often temporarily support the patient. Definitive treatment forpostinfarction cardiogenic shock is revascularization by thrombolysis of the clot, angioplasty, oremergency CABG. Revascularization usually greatly improves ventricular function. PCI or CABG may beconsidered for persistent ischemia, refractory ventricular arrhythmia, hemodynamic instability, or shock ifcoronary anatomy is suitable.\\nRV ischemia or infarction: RV infarction rarely occurs in isolation; it usually accompanies inferior LVinfarction, and the first sign may be hypotension developing in a previously stable patient. Right-sidedECG leads may show ST-segment changes. Volume loading with 1 to 2 L of 0.9% saline is ofteneffective. Dobutamine may help. Nitrates and diuretics are not used; they reduce preload (and hencecardiac output), causing severe hypotension. Increased right-sided filling pressure should be maintainedby IV fluid infusion.\\nRecurrent ischemia: Any chest pain that remains or recurs 12 to 24 h post-MI may represent recurrentischemia. Post-MI ischemic pain indicates that more myocardium is at risk of infarction. Usually, recurrentischemia can be identified by reversible ST-T changes on the ECG; BP may be elevated. However,because recurrent ischemia may be silent (ECG changes without pain) in up to one third of patients,serial ECGs are routinely obtained every 8 h for 1 day and then daily. Recurrent ischemia is treatedsimilarly to unstable angina. Sublingual or IV nitroglycerin is usually effective. Coronary angiography andPCI or CABG should be considered to salvage ischemic myocardium.\\nMural thrombosis: Mural thrombosis occurs in about 20% of patients with acute MI. Systemic embolismoccurs in about 10% of patients with LV thrombosis; risk is highest in the first 10 days but persists at least3 mo. Risk is highest (about 60%) for patients with large anterior infarctions (especially involving the distalseptum and apex), a dilated and diffusely hypokinetic LV, or chronic AF. Anticoagulants are given toreduce risk of emboli. If not contraindicated, full-dose IV heparin followed by warfarin for 3 to 6 mo isgiven to maintain INR between 2 and 3. Anticoagulants are continued indefinitely when a dilated diffuselyhypokinetic LV, LV aneurysm, or chronic AF is present. Aspirin may also be given indefinitely.\\nPericarditis: Pericarditis (see p. 2201) results from extension of myocardial necrosis through the wall tothe epicardium; it develops in about one third of patients with acute transmural MI. A friction rub usuallybegins 24 to 96 h after MI onset. Earlier onset of the friction rub is unusual, although hemorrhagicpericarditis occasionally complicates the early phase of MI. Acute tamponade is rare. Pericarditis isdiagnosed by ECG, which shows diffuse ST-segment elevation and sometimes PR-interval depression.Echocardiography is frequently done, but results are usually normal. Occasionally, small pericardialeffusions and even unsuspected tamponade are detected. Aspirin or another NSAID usually relievessymptoms. High doses or prolonged use of NSAIDs or corticosteroids may impair infarct healing andshould be avoided. Anticoagulation is not contraindicated in early peri-infarction pericarditis but iscontraindicated in later post-MI (Dressler's) syndrome.\\nPost-MI syndrome (Dressler's syndrome): Post-MI syndrome develops in a few patients several daysto weeks or even months after acute MI; incidence appears to have decreased in recent years. It ischaracterized by fever, pericarditis with a friction rub, pericardial effusion, pleurisy, pleural effusions,pulmonary infiltrates, and joint pain. This syndrome is caused by an autoimmune reaction to material fromnecrotic myocytes. It may recur. Differentiating post-MI syndrome from extension or recurrence ofinfarction may be difficult. However, in post-MI syndrome, cardiac markers do not increase significantly,and ECG changes are nonspecific. NSAIDs are usually effective, but the syndrome can recur severaltimes. In severe cases, a short, intensive course of another NSAID or a corticosteroid may be necessary.High doses of an NSAID or a corticosteroid are not used for more than a few days because they mayinterfere with early ventricular healing after an acute MI.\\nRehabilitation and Postdischarge Treatment\\n• Functional evaluation\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 210.

Heart Failure\\nIntroduction\\n(Congestive Heart Failure) (For heart failure in children, see p. 2947.)\\nHeart failure (HF) is a syndrome of ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular failure causesshortness of breath and fatigue, and right ventricular failure causes peripheral and abdominalfluid accumulation; the ventricles can be involved together or separately. Diagnosis is initiallyclinical, supported by chest x-ray, echocardiography, and levels of plasma natriuretic peptides.Treatment includes diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, β-blockers,aldosterone antagonists, digitalis, specialized implantable pacemakers, and correction of theunderlying disorder.\\nHF affects about 5 million people in the US; > 500,000 new cases occur each year.\\nPhysiology\\nCardiac contractility (force and velocity of contraction), ventricular performance, and myocardial O2requirements are determined by preload, afterload, substrate availability (eg, O2, fatty acids, glucose),heart rate and rhythm, and amount of viable myocardium. Cardiac output (CO) is the product of strokevolume and heart rate; it is also affected by venous return, peripheral vascular tone, and neurohumoralfactors.\\nPreload is the loading condition of the heart at the end of its relaxation phase (diastole) just beforecontraction (systole). Preload represents the degree of end-diastolic fiber stretch and end-diastolicvolume, which is influenced by ventricular diastolic pressure and the composition of the myocardial wall.Typically, left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure, especially if higher than normal, is a reasonablemeasure of preload. LV dilation, hypertrophy, and changes in myocardial distensibility (compliance) modifypreload.\\nAfterload is the force resisting myocardial fiber contraction at the start of systole; it is determined bychamber pressure, volume, and wall thickness at the time the aortic valve opens. Clinically, systemicsystolic BP at or shortly after the aortic valve opens represents peak systolic wall stress andapproximates afterload.\\nThe Frank-Starling principle describes the relationship between preload and cardiac performance. Itstates that, normally, systolic contractile performance (represented by stroke volume or CO) isproportional to preload within the normal physiologic range (seeFig. 211-1). Contractility is difficult to measure without cardiac catheterization but is reasonably reflectedby the ejection fraction (EF), which is the percentage of end-diastolic volume ejected with eachcontraction (LV stroke volume/end-diastolic volume); contractility can generally be adequately assessednoninvasively with echocardiography.\\nCardiac reserve is the ability of the heart to increase its performance above resting levels in response toemotional or physical stress; body O2 consumption may increase from 250 to ≥ 1500 mL/min duringmaximal exertion. Mechanisms include increasing heart rate, systolic and diastolic volume, stroke volume,and tissue extraction of O2 (the difference between O2 content in arterial blood and mixed venous orpulmonary artery blood). In well-trained young adults during maximal exercise, heart rate may increasefrom 55 to 70 beats/min at rest to 180 beats/min, and CO may increase from 6 to ≥ 25 L/min. At rest,arterial blood contains about 18 mL O2/dL of blood, and mixed venous or pulmonary artery blood containsabout 14 mL/dL. O2 extraction is thus about 4 mL/dL, but when demand is increased, it may increase to12 to 14 mL/dL. This mechanism also helps compensate for reduced tissue blood flow in HF.\\n[Fig. 211-1.

This condition canresult from abnormalities of systolic or diastolic function or, commonly, both. Although a primaryabnormality may be a change in myocyte function, there are also changes in collagen turnover of theextracellular matrix. Cardiac structural defects (eg, congenital defects, valvular disorders), rhythmabnormalities (including persistently high heart rate), and high metabolic demands (eg, fromthyrotoxicosis) also can cause HF.\\nSystolic dysfunction: In systolic dysfunction, the ventricle contracts poorly and empties inadequately,leading initially to increased diastolic volume and pressure and decreased EF. Many defects in energyutilization, energy supply, electrophysiologic functions, and contractile element interaction occur, withabnormalities in intracellular Ca modulation and cAMP production.\\nPredominant systolic dysfunction is common in HF due to MI, myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy.Systolic dysfunction may affect primarily the LV or the right ventricle (RV); LV failure often leads to RVfailure.\\nDiastolic dysfunction: In diastolic dysfunction (also called HF with preserved systolic function or HFwith preserved/normal EF), ventricular filling is impaired, resulting in reduced ventricular end-diastolicvolume, increased end-diastolic pressure, or both. Contractility and hence EF remain normal; EF mayeven increase as the poorly filled LV empties more completely to maintain CO. Markedly reduced LV fillingcan cause low CO and systemic symptoms. Elevated left atrial pressures can cause pulmonaryhypertension and pulmonary congestion.\\nDiastolic dysfunction usually results from impaired ventricular relaxation (an active process), increasedventricular stiffness, valvular disease, or constrictive pericarditis. Acute myocardial ischemia is also acause of diastolic dysfunction. Resistance to filling increases with age, probably reflecting myocyte lossand increased interstitial collagen deposition; thus, diastolic dysfunction is particularly common among theelderly. Diastolic dysfunction predominates in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, disorders with ventricularhypertrophy (eg, hypertension, significant aortic stenosis), and amyloid infiltration of the myocardium. LVfilling and function may also be impaired if marked increases in RV pressure shift the interventricularseptum to the left.\\nDiastolic dysfunction is increasingly being recognized as a cause of HF. Estimates vary, but about 50% ofpatients with HF have diastolic dysfunction and a normal EF; the prevalence increases with age.\\nLV failure: In failure due to LV dysfunction, CO decreases and pulmonary venous pressure increases.When pulmonary capillary pressure exceeds the oncotic pressure of plasma proteins (about 24 mm Hg),fluid extravasates from the capillaries into the interstitial space and alveoli, reducing pulmonarycompliance and increasing the work of breathing. Lymphatic drainage increases but cannot compensatefor the increase in pulmonary fluid. Marked fluid accumulation in alveoli (pulmonary edema) significantlyalters ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) relationships: Deoxygenated pulmonary arterial blood passes throughpoorly ventilated alveoli, decreasing systemic arterial oxygenation (PaO2) and causing dyspnea.However, dyspnea may occur before V/Q abnormalities, probably because of elevated pulmonary venouspressure and increased work of breathing; the precise mechanism is unclear. In severe or chronic LVfailure, pleural effusions characteristically develop in the right hemithorax and later bilaterally, furtheraggravating dyspnea. Minute ventilation increases; thus, PaCO2 decreases and blood pH increases(respiratory alkalosis). Marked interstitial edema of the small airways may interfere with ventilation,elevating PaCO2—a sign of impending respiratory failure.\\nRV failure: In failure due to RV dysfunction, systemic venous pressure increases, causing fluidextravasation and consequent edema, primarily in dependent tissues (feet and ankles of ambulatorypatients) and abdominal viscera. The liver is affected most, but the stomach and intestine also becomecongested; fluid accumulation in the peritoneal cavity (ascites) can occur. RV failure commonly causesmoderate hepatic dysfunction, with usually modest increases in conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin,\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 211.

The impaired liver breaks down lessaldosterone, further contributing to fluid accumulation. Chronic venous congestion in the viscera cancause anorexia, malabsorption of nutrients and drugs, protein-losing enteropathy (characterized bydiarrhea and marked hypoalbuminemia), chronic GI blood loss, and rarely ischemic bowel infarction.\\nCardiac response: If ventricular function is impaired, a higher preload is required to maintain CO. As aresult, the ventricles are remodeled over time: The LV becomes less ovoid and more spherical, dilates,and hypertrophies; the RV dilates and may hypertrophy. Initially compensatory, these changes eventuallyincrease diastolic stiffness and wall tension (ie, diastolic dysfunction develops), compromising cardiacperformance, especially during physical stress. Increased wall stress raises O2 demand and acceleratesapoptosis (programmed cell death) of myocardial cells. Dilation of the ventricles can also cause mitral ortricuspid valve regurgitation with further increases in end-diastolic volumes.\\nHemodynamic responses: With reduced CO, tissue O2 delivery is maintained by increasing O2extraction and sometimes shifting the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (seeFig. 189-4 on p. 1857) to the right to favor O2 release.\\nReduced CO with lower systemic BP activates arterial baroreflexes, increasing sympathetic tone anddecreasing parasympathetic tone. As a result, heart rate and myocardial contractility increase, arteriolesin selected vascular beds constrict, venoconstriction occurs, and Na and water are retained. Thesechanges compensate for reduced ventricular performance and help maintain hemodynamic homeostasisin the early stages of HF. However, these compensatory changes increase cardiac work, preload, andafterload; reduce coronary and renal perfusion; cause fluid accumulation resulting in congestion; increaseK excretion; and may cause myocyte necrosis and arrhythmias.\\nRenal responses: As cardiac function deteriorates, renal blood flow and GFR decrease, and blood flowwithin the kidneys is redistributed. The filtration fraction and filtered Na decrease, but tubular resorptionincreases, leading to Na and water retention. Blood flow is further redistributed away from the kidneysduring exercise, but renal blood flow improves during rest, possibly contributing to nocturia.\\nDecreased perfusion of the kidneys (and possibly decreased arterial systolic stretch secondary todeclining ventricular function) activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (see also p. 2066),increasing Na and water retention and renal and peripheral vascular tone. These effects are amplified bythe intense sympathetic activation accompanying HF.\\nThe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone [ADH]) system causes a cascade ofpotentially deleterious long-term effects. Angiotensin II worsens HF by causing vasoconstriction, includingefferent renal vasoconstriction, and by increasing aldosterone production, which not only enhances Nareabsorption in the distal nephron but also causes myocardial and vascular collagen deposition andfibrosis. Angiotensin II increases norepinephrine release, stimulates release of ADH, and triggersapoptosis. Angiotensin II may be involved in vascular and myocardial hypertrophy, thus contributing to theremodeling of the heart and peripheral vasculature, potentially worsening HF. Aldosterone can besynthesized in the heart and vasculature independently of angiotensin II (perhaps mediated bycorticotropin, nitric oxide, free radicals, and other stimuli) and may have deleterious effects in theseorgans.\\nHF that causes progressive renal dysfunction (including that renal dysfunction caused by drugs used totreat HF) contributes to worsening HF and has been termed the cardiorenal syndrome.\\nNeurohumoral responses: In conditions of stress, neurohumoral responses help increase heartfunction and maintain BP and organ perfusion, but chronic activation of these responses is detrimental tothe normal balance between myocardial-stimulating and vasoconstricting hormones and betweenmyocardial-relaxing and vasodilating hormones.\\nThe heart contains many neurohumoral receptors (α1, β1, β2, β3, angiotensin II type 1 [AT1] and type 2[AT2], muscarinic, endothelin, serotonin, adenosine, cytokine); the role of these receptors is not yet fullydefined.

The result of down-regulation isimpaired myocyte contractility and increased heart rate.\\nPlasma norepinephrine levels are increased, largely reflecting sympathetic nerve stimulation becauseplasma epinephrine levels are not increased. Detrimental effects include vasoconstriction with increasedpreload and afterload, direct myocardial damage including apoptosis, reduced renal blood flow, andactivation of other neurohumoral systems, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-ADH system.\\nADH is released in response to a fall in BP via various neurohormonal stimuli. Increased ADH decreasesrenal excretion of free water, possibly contributing to hyponatremia in HF. ADH levels in HF with normalBP vary.\\nAtrial natriuretic peptide is released in response to increased atrial volume and pressure; brain (B-type)natriuretic peptide (BNP) is released from the ventricle in response to ventricular stretching. Thesepeptides enhance renal excretion of Na, but in patients with HF, the effect is blunted by decreased renalperfusion pressure, receptor downregulation, and perhaps enhanced enzymatic degradation.\\nBecause endothelial dysfunction occurs in HF, fewer endogenous vasodilators (eg, nitric oxide,prostaglandins) are produced, and more endogenous vasoconstrictors (eg, endothelin) are produced,thus increasing afterload.\\nThe failing heart and other organs produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. This cytokine increasescatabolism and is possibly responsible for cardiac cachexia (loss of lean tissue ≥ 10%), which mayaccompany severely symptomatic HF, and for other detrimental changes. The failing heart alsoundergoes metabolic changes with increased free fatty acid utilization and decreased glucose utilization;these changes may become therapeutic targets.\\nChanges with aging: Age-related changes in the heart and cardiovascular system lower the thresholdfor expression of HF. Interstitial collagen within the myocardium increases, the myocardium stiffens, andmyocardial relaxation is prolonged. These changes lead to a significant reduction in diastolic LV function,even in healthy elderly people. Modest decline in systolic function also occurs with aging. An age-relateddecrease in myocardial and vascular responsiveness to β-adrenergic stimulation further impairs the abilityof the cardiovascular system to respond to increased work demands.\\nAs a result of these changes, peak exercise capacity decreases significantly (about 8%/decade after age30), and CO at peak exercise decreases more modestly. This decline can be slowed by regular physicalexercise. Thus, elderly patients are more prone than are younger ones to develop HF symptoms inresponse to the stress of systemic disorders or relatively modest cardiovascular insults. Stressors includeinfections (particularly pneumonia), hyperthyroidism, anemia, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, hypoxia,hyperthermia, renal failure, perioperative IV fluid loads, nonadherence to drug regimens or to low-saltdiets, and use of certain drugs (including NSAIDs, β-blockers, and certain Ca channel blockers).\\nEtiology\\nBoth cardiac and systemic factors can impair cardiac performance and cause or aggravate HF (seeTable 211-1).\\nClassification\\nThe traditional distinction of left and right ventricular failure is somewhat misleading because the heart isan integrated pump, and changes in one chamber ultimately affect the whole heart. However, these termsindicate the major site of pathology leading to HF and can be useful for initial evaluation and treatment.Other common descriptive terms include acute or chronic; congestive; high output or low output; systolicor diastolic; dilated or nondilated; and ischemic, hypertensive, or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.\\nLV failure characteristically develops in ischemic heart disease, hypertension, mitral or aortic valvularregurgitation, aortic stenosis, most forms of cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disorders (eg,ventricular septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus with large shunts).\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 211.

Conditions that may increase CO include severe anemia,beriberi, thyrotoxicosis, advanced Paget's disease, arteriovenous fistula, and persistent tachycardia. COis high in various forms of cirrhosis, but much of the observed fluid retention is due to hepaticmechanisms.\\nCardiomyopathy is a general term reflecting disease of the myocardium. Most commonly, the term refersto a primary disorder of the ventricular myocardium that is not caused by congenital anatomic defects;valvular, systemic, or pulmonary vascular disorders; isolated pericardial, nodal, or conduction systemdisorders; or epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD). The term is sometimes used to reflect etiology(eg, ischemic vs hypertensive cardiomyopathy). Cardiomyopathy does not always lead to symptomaticHF. It is often idiopathic and is classified as dilated congestive, hypertrophic, infiltrative-restrictive, orapical-ballooning cardiomyopathy.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nManifestations differ depending on the extent to which the LV and RV are initially affected. Clinicalseverity varies significantly and is usually classified according to the New York Heart Association system(seeTable 211-2); the examples of ordinary activity may be modified for elderly, debilitated patients. Severe LVfailure may cause pulmonary edema (see p. 2131) or cardiogenic shock (see p. 2294).\\nHistory: In LV failure, the most common symptoms are dyspnea, reflecting pulmonary congestion, andfatigue, reflecting low CO. Dyspnea usually occurs during exertion and is relieved by rest. As HFworsens, dyspnea can occur during rest and at night, sometimes causing nocturnal cough. Dyspneaoccurring immediately or soon after lying flat and relieved promptly by sitting up (orthopnea) is common asHF advances. In paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), dyspnea awakens patients several hours afterthey lie down and is relieved only after they sit up for 15 to 20 min. In severe HF, periodic cycling ofbreathing (Cheyne-Stokes respiration—see p.1827)—a brief period of increased breathing [hyperpnea] followed by a brief period of no breathing[apnea]—can occur during the day or night); the sudden hyperpneic phase may awaken the patient fromsleep. This breathing differs from PND in that the hyperpneic phase is short, lasting only a few secondsand resolving in < 1 min. PND is associated with pulmonary congestion, and Cheyne-Stokes respirationwith low CO. Sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea (see p. 1903), are common in HFand may aggravate HF. Severely reduced cerebral blood flow and hypoxemia can cause chronic irritabilityand impair mental performance.\\nIn RV failure, the most common symptoms are ankle swelling and fatigue. Sometimes patients feel asensation of fullness in the abdomen or neck.

Coexisting cognitive impairment anddepression may also influence assessment and therapeutic interventions and may be worsened by theHF.\\nExamination: General examination may detect signs of systemic disorders that cause or aggravate HF(eg, anemia, hyperthyroidism, alcoholism, hemochromatosis).\\nIn LV failure, tachycardia and tachypnea may occur. Patients with severe LV failure may appear visiblydyspneic or cyanotic, hypotensive, and confused or agitated because of hypoxia and poor cerebralperfusion. Some of these less specific symptoms (eg, confusion) are more common in the elderly.\\nCentral cyanosis (affecting all of the body, including warm areas such as the tongue and mucousmembranes) reflects severe hypoxemia.\\n[Table 211-2. New York Heart Association (Nyha) Classification of Heart Failure]\\nPeripheral cyanosis of the lips, fingers, and toes reflects low blood flow with increased O2 extraction. Ifvigorous massage improves nail bed color, cyanosis may be peripheral; increasing local blood flow doesnot improve color if cyanosis is central.\\nCardiac findings in LV systolic dysfunction include a diffuse, sustained, and laterally displaced apicalimpulse; audible and occasionally palpable 3rd (S3) and 4th (S4) heart sounds, and an accentuatedpulmonic component (P2) of the 2nd heart sound (S2). A pansystolic murmur of mitral regurgitation at theapex may occur. Pulmonary findings include inspiratory basilar crackles that do not clear with coughingand, if pleural effusion is present, dullness to percussion and diminished breath sounds at lung bases.\\nSigns of RV failure include nontender peripheral pitting edema (digital pressure leaves visible andpalpable imprints, sometimes quite deep) in the feet and ankles; an enlarged and sometimes pulsatileliver palpable below the right costal margin; abdominal swelling and ascites; and visible elevation of thejugular venous pressure, sometimes with large a or v waves that are visible even when the patient isseated or standing (seeFig. 206-1 on p. 2020). In severe cases, peripheral edema can extend to the thighs or even the sacrum,scrotum, lower abdominal wall, and occasionally even higher. Severe edema in multiple areas is termedanasarca. Edema may be asymmetric if patients lie predominantly on one side.\\nWith hepatic congestion, the liver may be palpably enlarged or tender, and hepatojugular or abdominal-jugular reflux may be detected (see p.2019). Precordial palpation may detect the left parasternal lift of RV enlargement, and auscultation maydetect the murmur of tricuspid regurgitation or the RV S3 along the left sternal border; both findings areaugmented upon inspiration.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Sometimes only clinical evaluation\\n• Chest x-ray\\n• Echocardiography\\n• Sometimes BNP or N-terminal-proBNP (NT-proBNP) levels\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 211.

Similar symptoms may result fromCOPD or recurrent pneumonia or may be erroneously attributed to obesity or old age. Suspicion for HFshould be high in patients with a history of MI, hypertension, or valvular disorders or murmurs and shouldbe moderate in any elderly or diabetic patient.\\nChest x-ray, ECG, and an objective test of cardiac function, typically echocardiography, should be done.Blood tests, except for BNP levels, are not used for diagnosis but are useful for identifying cause andsystemic effects.\\nChest x-ray: Chest x-ray findings suggesting HF include an enlarged cardiac silhouette, pleural effusion,fluid in the major fissure, and horizontal lines in the periphery of lower posterior lung fields (Kerley Blines). These findings reflect chronic elevation of left atrial pressure and chronic thickening of theintralobular septa due to edema. Upper lobe pulmonary venous congestion and interstitial or alveolaredema may also be present. Careful examination of the cardiac silhouette on a lateral projection canidentify specific ventricular and atrial chamber enlargement. The x-ray may also suggest alternativediagnoses (eg, COPD, pneumonia, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer).\\nECG: ECG findings are not diagnostic, but an abnormal ECG, especially showing previous MI, LVhypertrophy, left bundle branch block, or tachyarrhythmia (eg, rapid atrial fibrillation), increases suspicionfor HF and may help identify the cause. An entirely normal ECG is uncommon in chronic HF.\\nImaging: Echocardiography can help evaluate chamber dimensions, valve function, EF, wall motionabnormalities, LV hypertrophy, and pericardial effusion. Intracardiac thrombi, tumors, and calcificationswithin the heart valves, mitral annulus, and aortic wall abnormalities can be detected. Localized orsegmental wall motion abnormalities strongly suggest underlying CAD but can also be present withpatchy myocarditis. Doppler or color Doppler echocardiography accurately detects valvular disorders andshunts. Doppler studies of mitral and pulmonary venous inflow often help identify and quantify LV diastolicdysfunction; tissue Doppler imaging is more accurate. Measuring LVEF can distinguish betweenpredominant diastolic dysfunction (EF > 0.50) and systolic dysfunction (EF < 0.40). It is important to re-emphasize that HF can occur with a normal LVEF. Three-dimensional echocardiography may becomeimportant but currently is available only in specialized centers.\\nRadionuclide imaging also can help assess systolic and diastolic function, previous MI, and inducibleischemia or myocardial hibernation. Cardiac MRI provides accurate images of cardiac structures and isbecoming more widely available. In many centers, multimode imaging (eg, stress MIBI [thallium andsestamibi stress tests] plus CT angiography) is becoming common, although there is growing concernabout the radiation dose with CT angiography.\\nBlood tests: Serum BNP levels are high in HF; this finding may help when clinical findings are unclear orother diagnoses (eg, COPD) need to be excluded. It may be particularly useful for patients with a historyof both pulmonary and cardiac disorders. NT-proBNP, an inactive moiety created when proBNP iscleaved, can be used similarly.\\nRecommended blood tests include CBC, creatinine, BUN, electrolytes (including Mg and Ca), glucose,albumin, and liver function tests. Thyroid function tests are recommended for patients with atrial fibrillationand for selected, especially elderly, patients.\\nOther tests: Coronary angiography is indicated when CAD is suspected or the etiology of HF isuncertain. Cardiac catheterization with intracardiac pressure measurements may be helpful in thediagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathies and constrictive pericarditis.\\nEndocardial biopsy is sometimes done when an infiltrative cardiomyopathy is strongly suspected butcannot be confirmed with noninvasive imaging (eg, cardiac MRI).\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 211.

Mortality rate at 1 yrfrom first hospitalization for HF is about 30%. In chronic HF, mortality depends on severity of symptomsand ventricular dysfunction and can range from 10 to 40%/yr. Specific factors that suggest a poorprognosis include hypotension, low EF, presence of CAD, troponin release, elevation of BUN, reducedGFR, hyponatremia, and poor functional capacity (eg, as tested by a 6-min walk test).\\nHF usually involves gradual deterioration, interrupted by bouts of severe decompensation, and ultimatelydeath, although the time course is being lengthened with modern therapies. However, death can also besudden and unexpected, without prior worsening of symptoms.\\nEnd-of-life care: All patients and family members should be taught about disease progression. For somepatients, improving quality of life is as important as increasing quantity of life. Thus, it is important todetermine patients' wishes about resuscitation (eg, endotracheal intubation, CPR) if their conditiondeteriorates, especially when HF is already severe. All patients should be reassured that symptoms willbe relieved, and they should be encouraged to seek medical attention early if their symptoms changesignificantly.

The patient and family should beinvolved in treatment choices. They should be taught the importance of drug adherence, warning signs ofdecompensation, and how to link cause with effect (eg, increased salt in the diet with weight gain orsymptoms).\\nMany centers (eg, specialized outpatient clinics) have integrated health care practitioners from differentdisciplines (eg, HF nurses, pharmacists, social workers, rehabilitation specialists) into multidisciplinaryteams or outpatient HF management programs. These approaches can improve outcomes and reducehospitalizations and are most effective in the sickest patients.\\nDietary Na restriction helps limit fluid retention. All patients should eliminate salt in cooking and at thetable and avoid salted foods; the most severely ill should limit Na to < 2 g/day by consuming only low-Nafoods. Monitoring daily morning weight helps detect Na and water accumulation early. If weight increases> 2 kg over a few days, patients may be able to adjust their diuretic dose themselves, but if weight gaincontinues or symptoms occur, patients should seek medical attention. Intensive case management,particularly by monitoring drug adherence and frequency of unscheduled visits to the physician oremergency department and hospitalizations, can identify when intervention is needed. Specialized HFnurses are valuable in education, follow-up, and dosage adjustment according to predefined protocols.\\nPatients with atherosclerosis or diabetes should strictly follow a diet appropriate for their disorder. Obesitymay cause and always aggravates the symptoms of HF; patients should attain a body mass index (BMI)of 21 to 25.\\nRegular light activity (eg, walking), tailored to symptoms, is generally encouraged. Activity preventsskeletal muscle deconditioning, which worsens functional status; whether this measure improves survivalis under study. Rest is appropriate during acute exacerbations. The role of formal exercise rehabilitationprograms is being studied; initial results appear favorable.\\nIf hypertension, severe anemia, hemochromatosis, uncontrolled diabetes, thyrotoxicosis, beriberi,alcoholism, Chagas' disease, or toxoplasmosis is successfully treated, patients may dramatically improve.Significant myocardial ischemia should be treated aggressively; treatment may include revascularizationby percutaneous coronary intervention (see p. 2059) or bypass surgery (see p. 2052).

Sustained ventricular tachycardia that persists despitecorrection of cause (eg, low K or Mg, ischemia) and optimal medical treatment of HF may require anantiarrhythmic drug. Amiodarone and β-blockers are the drugs of choice because other antiarrhythmicshave adverse proarrhythmic effects when LV systolic dysfunction is present. Because amiodaroneincreases digoxin levels, the digoxin dose should be decreased by half. Because long-term use ofamiodarone can cause adverse effects, a low-dose (200 to 300 mg po once/day) is used when possible;blood tests for liver function and thyroid-stimulating hormone are done every 6 mo, and if chest x-ray isabnormal or dyspnea worsens significantly, chest x-ray and pulmonary function tests are done yearly tocheck for pulmonary fibrosis. For sustained ventricular arrhythmias, amiodarone may be required; toreduce risk of sudden death, a loading dose of 400 to 800 mg po bid is given for 1 to 3 wk until rhythmcontrol is adequate, then dose is decreased over 1 mo to a maintenance dose of 400 mg po once/day.\\nDevice therapy: Use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or biventricular pacing isappropriate for some patients.\\nAn ICD is recommended for patients with an otherwise good life expectancy if they have symptomaticsustained ventricular tachycardia (especially if it causes syncope), ventricular fibrillation, or an LVEFpersistently < 0.30 while receiving good medical therapy.\\nBiventricular pacing (cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT]) may relieve symptoms and reduce HFhospitalizations for patients who have HF, LVEF < 0.35, and a widened QRS complex (> 0.12 sec). Betterways of detecting ventricular dyssynchrony may help identify patients most likely to respond to CRT. CRTdevices are effective but expensive, and patients must be appropriately selected.\\nUltrafiltration (venovenous filtration) can be useful in selected hospitalized patients with severe volumeoverload if they have not responded well to diuretic therapy and have rising serum creatinine (cardiorenalsyndrome). Long-term benefits are still unclear.\\nAn intra-aortic counterpulsation balloon pump is helpful in selected patients who have a good chance ofrecovery (eg, acute HF following MI). LV assist devices are implantable pumps that augment LV output.They were initially used only as a short-term intervention to maintain patients with severe HF awaitingtransplant but are sometimes now used for extended periods (1 to 2 yr) in patients who are not transplantcandidates. However, although survival can be prolonged, few patients are able to recover sufficiently totolerate device removal.\\nSurgery: Surgery may be appropriate when certain underlying disorders are present. Usually, surgery inHF patients should be done in a specialized center. Surgical closure of congenital or acquiredintracardiac shunts can be curative. Coronary artery bypass grafting to reduce ischemia may help somepatients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and is currently being studied in a large clinical trial of HF patientswith ischemic systolic dysfunction. If HF is primarily due to a valvular disorder, valve repair or replacementis considered (see Ch. 214). Patients with primary mitral regurgitation are more likely to benefit thanpatients with mitral regurgitation secondary to LV dilation, in whom myocardial function is likely to continueto be poor postoperatively. Surgery is preferably done before myocardial dilation and damage becomeirreversible.\\nHeart transplantation (see p. 1131) is the treatment of choice for patients < 60 who have severe,refractory HF and no other life-threatening conditions and who are highly adherent to managementrecommendations. Some older patients with otherwise excellent health may be considered. Survival is82% at 1 yr and 75% at 3 yr; however, mortality rate while waiting for a donor is 12 to 15%.

Surgical options studied include implantation of restraining devices to reduceprogressive dilation and a modified aneurysmectomy called surgical ventricular restoration, but neithershowed clinical benefit.\\nDynamic cardiomyoplasty, endocardial laser therapy, and excision of segments of dilated myocardium areno longer recommended.\\nPersistent HF: After treatment, symptoms often persist. Reasons include persistence of the underlyingdisorder (eg, hypertension, ischemia, valvular regurgitation) despite treatment; suboptimal treatment ofHF; drug nonadherence; excess intake of dietary Na or alcohol; and presence of an undiagnosed thyroiddisorder, anemia, or supervening arrhythmia (eg, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response,intermittent ventricular tachycardia). Also, drugs used to treat other disorders may interfere with HFtreatment. NSAIDs, thiazolidinediones (eg, pioglitazone) for diabetes, and short-acting dihydropyridine ornondihydropyridine Ca channel blockers can worsen HF and should be avoided unless no alternativeexists; patients who must take such drugs should be followed closely.\\nDrugs\\n• Symptom relief: Diuretics, nitrates, or digoxin\\n• Long-term management and improved survival: ACE inhibitors, β-blockers, aldosterone receptorblockers, or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)\\nAll these drug classes have been studied in systolic dysfunction, but fewer have been adequately studiedin diastolic dysfunction. However, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and β-blockers are generally used to treatdiastolic HF. In patients with severe diastolic dysfunction, diuretics and nitrates should be used in lowerdoses because these patients do not tolerate reduced BP or plasma volume well. In patients withhypertrophic cardiomyopathy (see p. 2138), digoxin is not effective and may be harmful. All patientsshould be given clear and explicit information about their drugs, including the importance of timelyprescription renewal and adherence to therapy, how to recognize adverse effects, and when to contacttheir physician. Research is seeking plasma biomarkers that may predict which patients might respondbest to which drug or drug combination.\\nDiuretics: Diuretics (seeTable 208-5 on p. 2073) are given to all patients with symptomatic systolic dysfunction and current orprevious volume overload; dose is adjusted to the lowest dose that stabilizes weight and relievessymptoms. Loop diuretics are preferred. Furosemide is used most often, starting at 20 to 40 mg poonce/day, increased to 120 mg once/day (or 60 mg bid) if needed based on response and renal function.Bumetanide is an alternative. In refractory cases, furosemide 40 to 160 mg IV, ethacrynic acid 50 to 100mg IV, bumetanide 0.5 to 2 mg po or 0.5 to 1.0 mg IV, or metolazone 2.5 to 10 mg po may have an additiveeffect. IV infusion of furosemide (5 to 10 mg/h) may be helpful in selected patients with severe edema.Loop diuretics (particularly when used with metolazone) may cause hypovolemia with hypotension,hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, and severe hypokalemia. The dose of diuretic required acutely canusually be gradually reduced when HF improves, and the diuretic may be stopped if other drugs improveheart function and clear HF symptoms. Using larger than required doses of diuretics lowers CO, impairsrenal function, causes hypokalemia, and increases mortality. Serum electrolytes are monitored, initiallydaily (when diuretics are given IV) and subsequently as needed, particularly after a dose increase.\\nA K-sparing diuretic, either spironolactone or eplerenone (which are aldosterone receptor blockers), canbe added to offset the K-losing effects of higher-dose loop diuretics. Hyperkalemia may result, especiallywhen ACE inhibitors or ARBs are also taken, so electrolytes must still be monitored, especially during adehydrating illness that could cause renal dysfunction. These drugs may have particular benefit in chronicRV failure, in which hepatic congestion results in elevated aldosterone levels as its metabolism isreduced.\\nThiazide diuretics are not normally used as a single agent unless hypertension is present but may beadded to furosemide for added diuresis.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 211.

They should seek medical attention promptly if weight gain persists.\\nExperimental ADH blockers increase water excretion and serum Na levels and may cause lesshypokalemia and renal dysfunction. Their clinical role remains to be defined.\\nACE inhibitors: All patients with systolic dysfunction are given oral ACE inhibitors unless contraindicated(eg, by plasma creatinine > 2.8 mg/dL [> 250 μmol/L], bilateral renal artery stenosis, renal artery stenosisin a solitary kidney, or previous angioedema due to ACE inhibitors).\\nACE inhibitors reduce production of angiotensin II and breakdown of bradykinin, mediators that affect thesympathetic nervous system, endothelial function, vascular tone, and myocardial performance.Hemodynamic effects include arterial and venous vasodilation, sustained decreases in LV filling pressureduring rest and exercise, decreased systemic vascular resistance, and favorable effects on ventricularremodeling. ACE inhibitors prolong survival and reduce HF hospitalizations. For patients withatherosclerosis and a vascular disorder, these drugs reduce MI and stroke risk. For patients withdiabetes, they delay onset of nephropathy. Thus, ACE inhibitors may be used in patients with diastolicdysfunction and any of these disorders.\\nThe starting dose typically should be low (usually one fourth to one half of the target dose depending onBP and renal function); the dose is gradually adjusted upward over 8 wk as tolerated, then continuedindefinitely. Usual target doses of representative drugs include enalapril 10 to 20 mg bid, lisinopril 20 to30 mg once/day, ramipril 5 mg bid, and captopril 50 mg tid.\\nIf the hypotensive effect (more marked in patients with hyponatremia or volume depletion) is troublesome,it can often be minimized by separating administration of other BP-lowering drugs or reducing the dose ofconcomitant diuretics. ACE inhibitors often cause mild to moderate reversible serum creatinine elevationdue to vasodilation of the efferent glomerular arteriole. An initial 20 to 30% increase in creatinine is noreason to stop the drug but does require slower increases in dose, reduction in diuretic dose, oravoidance of NSAIDs. Because aldosterone's effect is reduced, K retention may result, especially inpatients receiving K supplements. Cough occurs in 5 to 15% of patients, probably because bradykininaccumulates, but other causes of cough should also be considered. Occasionally, rash or dysgeusiaoccurs. Angioedema is rare but can be life threatening and is a contraindication to this class of drugs.Alternatively, ARBs can be used, although rarely cross-reactivity is reported. Both are contraindicated inpregnancy.\\nSerum electrolytes and renal function should be measured before an ACE inhibitor is started, at 1 mo, andafter each significant increase in dose or change in clinical condition. If dehydration or poor renal functiondue to acute illness develops, the ACE inhibitor dose may need to be reduced or the drug may betemporarily withheld.\\nARBs: These drugs are not demonstrably superior to ACE inhibitors but are less likely to cause coughand angioedema; they may be used when these adverse effects prohibit ACE inhibitor use. ACE inhibitorsand ARBs are equally effective post MI; however, their equivalence is less clear in chronic HF, and thebest dose is still under study. Usual oral target doses are valsartan 160 mg bid, candesartan 32 mgonce/day, and losartan 50 to 100 mg once/day. Introduction, upward titration, and monitoring of ARBs andACE inhibitors are similar. Like ACE inhibitors, ARBs can cause reversible renal dysfunction, and the dosemay need to be reduced or withheld temporarily during an acute dehydrating illness.\\nAdding an ARB to a regimen of an ACE inhibitor, β-blocker, and diuretic should be considered for HFpatients with persistent symptoms and repeated hospitalizations. Such combination therapy requiresincreased monitoring of BP, serum electrolytes, and renal function.\\nAldosterone receptor blockers: Because aldosterone can be produced independently of the renin-angiotensin system, its adverse effects are not inhibited completely even by maximal use of ACEinhibitors and ARBs. Thus, the aldosterone receptor blockers spironolactone, 25 to 50 mg po once/day,and eplerenone, 10 mg po once/day (does not cause gynecomastia in males), can reduce mortality,including from sudden death, in patients with LVEF < 30% and severe chronic HF or acute HF\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 211.

Serum K and creatinine should be checkedevery 1 to 2 wk for the first 4 to 6 wk and after dose changes; dose is lowered if K is between 5.5 and 6.0mEq/L and stopped if K is > 6.0 mEq/L, if creatinine increases above 2.5 mg/dL (220 μmol/L), or if ECGchanges of hyperkalemia are present. These drugs are usually not used in patients receiving both anACE inhibitor and an ARB because of the high risk of hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction.\\nβ-Blockers: β-Blockers, unless otherwise contraindicated (by asthma, 2nd- or 3rd-degree atrioventricularblock, or previous intolerance), are an important addition to ACE inhibitors for chronic systolic dysfunctionin most patients, including the elderly, and for diastolic dysfunction in hypertension and hypertrophiccardiomyopathy. They are best started when the patient has no evidence of pulmonary congestion. Someof these drugs improve LVEF, survival, and other major cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronicsystolic dysfunction, including those with severe symptoms. β-Blockers are particularly useful for diastolicdysfunction because they reduce heart rate, prolonging diastolic filling time, and possibly improveventricular relaxation.\\nThe starting dose should be low (one fourth of the target daily dose), then dose is gradually increasedover 8 wk as tolerated. The acute negative inotropic effects of β-blockade may cause cardiac depressionand fluid retention. In such cases, a temporary increase in diuretic dose and slower upward titration of theβ-blocker dose is warranted. Tolerance may improve over time, and efforts should be made to reachtarget doses. Usual oral target doses are carvedilol 25 mg bid (50 mg bid for patients ≥ 85 kg), bisoprolol10 mg once/day, and metoprolol 50 to 75 mg bid (tartrate) or 200 mg once/day (succinate extended-release). Carvedilol, a 3rd-generation nonselective β-blocker, is also a vasodilator with α-blocking andantioxidant effects; it is the preferred and most widely studied β-blocker but is more expensive in manycountries. Some β-blockers (eg, bucindolol, xamoterol) do not appear beneficial and may be harmful.\\nDuring a severe, acute decompensation, β-blockers should not be started until patients are stabilized andhave little evidence of fluid retention. For patients already taking a β-blocker, the dose may be temporarilyreduced or, in severe decompensation, temporarily withheld but restarted and titrated again when patientsare stable. For milder decompensations, the β-blocker dose should be continued with a temporaryincrease in diuretic dose.\\nAfter initial treatment, heart rate and myocardial O2 consumption decrease, and stroke volume and fillingpressure are unchanged. With the slower heart rate, diastolic function improves. Ventricular filling returnsto a more normal pattern (increasing in early diastole), which appears less restrictive. Improvedmyocardial function is measurable in some patients after 6 to 12 mo but may take longer; EF and COincrease, and LV filling pressure decreases. Exercise capacity improves.\\nVasodilators: Hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate may help patients truly intolerant of ACE inhibitors orARBs (usually because of significant renal dysfunction), although long-term benefit of this combination islimited. In African-American patients, this combination may also provide some additional benefits whenadded to standard therapy. As vasodilators, these drugs improve hemodynamics, reduce valvularregurgitation, and increase exercise capacity without causing significant renal impairment. Hydralazine isstarted at 25 mg po qid and increased every 3 to 5 days to a target total dose of 300 mg/day, althoughmany patients cannot tolerate > 200 mg/day because of hypotension. Isosorbide dinitrate is started at 20mg po tid (with a 12-h nitrate-free interval) and increased to a target of 40 to 50 mg tid. Whether lowerdoses (frequently used in clinical practice) provide long-term benefit is unknown. In general, vasodilatorshave been replaced by ACE inhibitors, which are easier to use, are usually better tolerated, and havegreater proven benefit.\\nNitrates alone can relieve HF symptoms; patients can be taught to use sublingual nitroglycerin spray asneeded for acute dyspnea and a transdermal patch for nocturnal dyspnea. Nitrates are safe, effective,and well tolerated and are particularly helpful in patients with HF and angina. Adverse effects includehypotension and headache.\\nOther vasodilators such as Ca channel blockers are not used to treat systolic dysfunction. Short-actingdihydropyridines (eg, nifedipine) and nondihydropyridines (eg, diltiazem, verapamil) may be deleterious.However, amlodipine and felodipine are well tolerated and may be useful for patients with HF andassociated angina or hypertension.

Felodipine should not be taken with grapefruit juice, which significantly increasesplasma levels and adverse effects by inhibiting cytochrome P-450 metabolism. In patients with diastolicdysfunction, Ca channel blockers may be used as needed to treat hypertension or ischemia or to controlventricular rate in atrial fibrillation. Verapamil may be used in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\\nDigitalis preparations: These drugs inhibit the Na-K pump (Na+, K+-ATPase). As a result, they causeweak positive inotropism, reduce sympathetic activity, block the atrioventricular node (slowing theventricular rate in atrial fibrillation or prolonging the PR interval in sinus rhythm), reduce vasoconstriction,and improve renal blood flow. Digoxin is the most commonly prescribed digitalis preparation. It is excretedby the kidneys; elimination half-life is 36 to 40 h in patients with normal renal function.\\nDigoxin has no proven survival benefit but, when used with diuretics and an ACE inhibitor, may helpcontrol symptoms and reduce the likelihood of hospitalization. Digoxin is most effective in patients withlarge LV end-diastolic volumes and an S3. Acute withdrawal of digoxin may increase the hospitalizationrate and worsen symptoms. In patients with normal renal function, digoxin, 0.125 to 0.375 mg po once/daydepending on age, sex, and body size, achieves full digitalization in about 1 wk (5 half-lives). More rapiddigitalization can be achieved with digoxin 0.5 mg IV over 15 min followed by 0.25 mg IV at 8 and 16 h orwith 0.5 mg po followed by 0.25 mg po at 8, 16, and 24 h. Prescription patterns vary widely by physicianand by country, but in general, doses are lower than those used in the past, and a trough (8- to 12-h post-dose) digoxin level of 1 ng/mL is acceptable.\\nToxicity is a concern, especially in patients with renal dysfunction and perhaps in women. These patientsmay need a lower oral dose, as may elderly patients, patients with a low lean body mass, and patientsalso taking amiodarone; patients > 80 kg may need a higher dose. Digoxin (and all digitalis glycosides)has a narrow therapeutic window. The most important toxic effects are life-threatening arrhythmias (eg,ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, complete atrioventricular block). Bidirectional ventriculartachycardia, nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia in the presence of atrial fibrillation, and hyperkalemiaare serious signs of digitalis toxicity. Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, confusion, amblyopia, and,rarely, xerophthalmia may occur. If hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia (often due to diuretic use) is present,lower doses and serum levels can still cause toxicity. Electrolyte levels should be monitored in patientstaking diuretics and digoxin, so that abnormalities can be prevented if possible; K-sparing diuretics maybe helpful.\\nWhen digitalis toxicity occurs, the drug should be stopped; electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected(IV if abnormalities are severe and toxicity is acute). Patients with severe toxicity are admitted to amonitored unit, and digoxin immune Fab (ovine antidigoxin antibody fragments) is given if arrhythmias arepresent or if significant overingestion is accompanied by a serum K of > 5 mEq/L. This drug is also usefulfor glycoside toxicity due to plant ingestion. Dose is based on the steady-state serum digoxin level or totalamount ingested. Ventricular arrhythmias are treated with lidocaine or phenytoin. Atrioventricular blockwith a slow ventricular rate may require a temporary transvenous pacemaker. Isoproterenol iscontraindicated because it increases risk of ventricular arrhythmia.\\nOther drugs: Various positive inotropic drugs have been evaluated in HF but, except for digoxin, theyincrease mortality risk. Regular outpatient IV infusions of inotropes (eg, dobutamine) increase mortalityand are not recommended. Drugs under study include Ca sensitizers (eg, levosimendan), cytokineblockers, endothelin blockers, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors, and immune modulators.\\nPulmonary Edema\\nPulmonary edema is acute, severe left ventricular failure with pulmonary venous hypertensionand alveolar flooding. Findings are severe dyspnea, diaphoresis, wheezing, and sometimesblood-tinged frothy sputum. Diagnosis is clinical and by chest x-ray. Treatment is with O2, IVnitrates, diuretics, and sometimes morphine and short-term IV positive inotropes, endotrachealintubation, and mechanical ventilation.\\nIf left ventricular (LV) filling pressure increases suddenly, plasma fluid moves rapidly from pulmonarycapillaries into interstitial spaces and alveoli, causing pulmonary edema.

Because fluid status before onset of pulmonary edema isusually normal in patients with acute MI, diuretics are less useful than in patients with chronic HF and mayprecipitate hypotension. If systolic BP falls < 100 mm Hg or shock develops, IV dobutamine and an intra-aortic balloon pump (counterpulsation) may be required (see p. 2297).\\nOnce patients are stabilized, long-term HF treatment is as described on p. 2126.\\nCor Pulmonale\\nCor pulmonale is right ventricular enlargement secondary to a lung disorder that causespulmonary artery hypertension. Right ventricular failure follows. Findings include peripheraledema, neck vein distention, hepatomegaly, and a parasternal lift. Diagnosis is clinical and byechocardiography. Treatment is directed at the cause.\\nCor pulmonale results from a disorder of the lung or its vasculature; it does not refer to right ventricular(RV) enlargement secondary to left ventricular (LV) failure, a congenital heart disorder (eg, ventricularseptal defect), or an acquired valvular disorder. Cor pulmonale is usually chronic but may be acute andreversible. Primary pulmonary hypertension (ie, not caused by a pulmonary or cardiac disorder) isdiscussed elsewhere (see p. 2065).\\nPathophysiology\\nLung disorders cause pulmonary hypertension by several mechanisms:\\n• Loss of capillary beds (eg, due to bullous changes in COPD or thrombosis in pulmonary embolism)\\n• Vasoconstriction caused by hypoxia, hypercapnia, or both\\n• Increased alveolar pressure (eg, in COPD, during mechanical ventilation)\\n• Medial hypertrophy in arterioles (often a response to pulmonary hypertension due to other mechanisms)\\nPulmonary hypertension increases afterload on the RV, resulting in a cascade of events that is similar towhat occurs in LV failure, including elevated end-diastolic and central venous pressure and ventricularhypertrophy and dilation. Demands on the RV may be intensified by increased blood viscosity due tohypoxia-induced polycythemia. Rarely, RV failure affects the LV if a dysfunctional septum bulges into theLV, interfering with filling and thus causing diastolic dysfunction.\\nEtiology\\nAcute cor pulmonale has few causes.

Later, as RV pressures increase, physicalsigns commonly include a left parasternal systolic lift, a loud pulmonic component of the 2nd heart sound(S2), and murmurs of functional tricuspid and pulmonic insufficiency. Later, an RV gallop rhythm (3rd [S3]and 4th [S4] heart sounds) augmented during inspiration, distended jugular veins (with a dominant awave unless tricuspid regurgitation is present), hepatomegaly, and lower-extremity edema may occur.\\n[Table 211-3.

However, because pulmonary hyperinflation and bullae in COPDcause realignment of the heart, physical examination, x-rays, and ECG may be relatively insensitive.Echocardiography or radionuclide imaging is done to evaluate LV and RV function; echocardiography canassess RV systolic pressure but is often technically limited by the lung disorder.

Cardiomyopathies\\nIntroduction\\nA cardiomyopathy is a primary disorder of the heart muscle. It is distinct from structural cardiac disorderssuch as coronary artery disease, valvular disorders, and congenital heart disorders. Cardiomyopathiesare divided into 3 main types: dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive (seeFig. 212-1) based on the pathologic features. The term ischemic cardiomyopathy refers to the dilated,poorly contracting myocardium that sometimes occurs in patients with severe coronary artery disease(with or without areas of infarction). Although it does not describe a primary myocardial disorder, the termremains in common use.\\nManifestations of cardiomyopathies are usually those of heart failure and vary depending on whetherthere is systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, or both (see p. 2119). Some cardiomyopathies mayalso cause chest pain, syncope, or sudden death.\\nEvaluation typically includes ECG and echocardiography and sometimes MRI. Some patients requireendomyocardial biopsy (transvenous right ventricular or retrograde left ventricular). Other tests are doneas needed to determine the cause. Treatment depends on the specific type and cause of cardiomyopathy(seeTable 212-1).\\nDilated Cardiomyopathy\\nDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is myocardial dysfunction causing heart failure in whichventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction predominate. Symptoms include dyspnea, fatigue,and peripheral edema. Diagnosis is clinical and by chest x-ray and echocardiography. Treatmentis directed at the cause; if progressive and severe, heart transplantation may be needed.\\nPathophysiology\\nIn some patients, DCM is believed to start with acute myocarditis (probably viral in most cases), followedby a variable latent phase, a phase with diffuse necrosis of myocardial myocytes (due to an autoimmunereaction to virus-altered myocytes), and chronic fibrosis. Regardless of the cause, the myocardiumdilates, thins, and hypertrophies in compensation (see Fig. 212-1), often leading to functional mitral ortricuspid regurgitation and atrial dilation.\\nThe disorder affects both ventricles in most patients, only the left ventricle (LV) in a few (unless with anischemic etiology), and only the right ventricle (RV) rarely.\\nMural thrombi frequently form once chamber dilation is significant, especially during the acute myocarditisphase. Cardiac arrhythmias often complicate the acute myocarditis and late chronic dilated phases asmay atrioventricular (AV) block. Atrial fibrillation commonly occurs as the left atrium dilates.\\nEtiology\\nDCM has many known and probably many unidentified causes (seeTable 212-2). The most common cause in temperate zones is diffuse coronary artery disease (CAD) withdiffuse ischemic myopathy. More than 20 viruses can cause DCM; in temperate zones, coxsackievirus Bis most common. In Central and South America, Chagas' disease due to Trypanosoma cruzi is the mostcommon infectious cause. DCM is becoming increasingly common among patients with HIV infection.Other causes include toxoplasmosis, thyrotoxicosis, and beriberi. Many toxic substances, particularlyalcohol, various organic solvents, and certain chemotherapeutic drugs (eg, doxorubicin, trastuzumab),damage the heart.\\nStress and other hyperadrenergic states can trigger acute DCM that is typically reversible (as is thatcaused by prolonged episodes of tachycardia). An example is acute apical ballooning cardiomyopathy(takotsubo cardiomyopathy); in this disorder, only the apex of the LV is affected, causing regional wall\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 212.

Symptoms depend on which ventricle is affected. LV dysfunctioncauses exertional dyspnea and fatigue due to elevated LV diastolic pressure and low cardiac output. RVfailure causes peripheral edema and neck vein distention. Infrequently the RV is predominantly affected inyounger patients, and atrial arrhythmias and sudden death due to malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmiasare typical. About 25% of all patients with DCM have atypical chest pain.\\n[Fig. 212-1. Forms of cardiomyopathy.]\\n[Table 212-1. Diagnosis and Treatment of Cardiomyopathies]\\nDiagnosis\\n• Chest x-ray\\n• ECG\\n• Echocardiography\\n• Testing for cause as indicated\\nDiagnosis is by history, physical examination, and exclusion of other common causes of ventricular failure(eg, systemic hypertension, primary valvular disorders, MI—see Table 212-1). Thus, chest x-ray, ECG,and echocardiography are required. If acute symptoms or chest pain is present, serum cardiac markersare measured; although typically indicative of coronary ischemia, troponin levels can be elevated in heartfailure, especially if renal function is decreased. Specific causes suspected clinically are diagnosed (seeelsewhere in THE MANUAL). If no specific cause is clinically apparent, serum ferritin and iron-bindingcapacity and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are measured and serologic tests for Toxoplasma, T.cruzi,\\n[Table 212-2. Causes of Dilated Cardiomyopathy]\\ncoxsackievirus, and echovirus may be done in appropriate cases.\\nChest x-ray shows cardiomegaly, usually of all chambers. Pleural effusion, particularly on the right, oftenaccompanies increased pulmonary venous pressure and interstitial edema.\\nThe ECG may show sinus tachycardia and nonspecific ST-segment depression with low voltage orinverted T waves. Sometimes pathologic Q waves are present in the precordial leads, simulating previousMI. Left bundle branch block is common.\\nEchocardiography shows dilated, hypokinetic cardiac chambers and rules out primary valvulardisorders. Segmental wall motion abnormalities, typical of MI, can also occur in DCM because theprocess may be patchy. Echocardiography may also show a mural thrombus. MRI is not routinely donebut may be useful when detailed imaging of myocardial structure or function is needed. Incardiomyopathy, MRI may show abnormal myocardial tissue texture.\\nCoronary angiography is required when the diagnosis is in doubt after noninvasive tests, particularly forpatients with chest pain or several cardiovascular risk factors or for elderly patients, who are more likelyto have CAD. However, nonobstructive coronary artery lesions detected by angiography may not be thecause of DCM. Either ventricle can be biopsied during catheterization, but biopsy is not usually donebecause the yield can be low, the disease process can be patchy, and results may not change treatment.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 212.

Antivirals are not helpful.\\nBecause mural thrombi may form, prophylactic oral anticoagulants (see p. 2228) are often given to helpprevent systemic or pulmonary emboli, and a large randomized trial is underway to test whether thisapproach is effective. Patients with a previous cerebrovascular embolism, those with acute severemyocarditis, and some with severe LV dilation should receive anticoagulants.\\nAggressive treatment of heart failure reduces risk of arrhythmia, but significant cardiac arrhythmias maybe treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Permanent pacemakers may be required if AV block occurs duringthe chronic dilated phase. However, AV block during acute myocarditis often resolves, so permanentpacemakers are usually not needed. If patients have a widened QRS interval with a low LV ejectionfraction and severe symptoms despite optimized medical treatment, biventricular pacing should beconsidered. An implantable cardioverterdefibrillator may be used to prevent sudden arrhythmia-induceddeath.\\nBecause prognosis may be poor, patients with DCM may become candidates for heart transplantation.Selection criteria include absence of associated systemic disorders and psychologic disorders and high,irreversible pulmonary vascular resistance; because donor hearts are scarce, younger patients (usually <60) are given higher priority.\\nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy\\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a congenital or acquired disorder characterized bymarked ventricular hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction but without increased afterload (eg,from valvular aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, systemic hypertension). Symptomsinclude dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, and sudden death. A systolic murmur, increased byValsalva maneuver, is typically present in the hypertrophic obstructive type. Diagnosis is byechocardiography. Treatment is with β-blockers, verapamil, disopyramide, and sometimeschemical reduction or surgical removal of outflow tract obstruction.\\nHCM is a common cause of sudden death in young athletes (see p. 2236).

Perhaps 1 in 500 people isaffected; phenotypic expression varies markedly.\\nPathophysiology\\nThe myocardium is abnormal with cellular and myofibrillar disarray, although this finding is not specific forHCM. In the most common form, the upper interventricular septum below the aortic valve is markedlyhypertrophied and thickened, with little or no hypertrophy of the left ventricular (LV) posterior wall; thispattern is called asymmetric septal hypertrophy. During systole, the septum thickens, and sometimes theanterior leaflet of the mitral valve, already abnormally oriented because of the abnormally shapedventricle, is sucked toward the septum by a Venturi effect of high velocity blood flow, further obstructingthe outflow tract and decreasing cardiac output. The resulting disorder may be termed hypertrophicobstructive cardiomyopathy. Less commonly, midventricular hypertrophy leads to an intracavitary gradientat the papillary muscle level. In both forms, the distal LV may ultimately thin and dilate. Apical hypertrophycan also occur but does not obstruct outflow, although it may obliterate the apical portion of the LV duringsystole. Sometimes the hypertrophy is diffuse and symmetrical.\\nContractility is grossly normal, resulting in a normal ejection fraction (EF). Later, EF is elevated becausethe ventricle has a small volume and empties nearly completely to maintain cardiac output.\\nHypertrophy results in a stiff, noncompliant chamber (usually the LV) that resists diastolic filling, elevatingend-diastolic pressure and thus increasing pulmonary venous pressure. As resistance to filling increases,cardiac output decreases, an effect worsened by any outflow tract gradient present. Because tachycardiaallows less time for filling, symptoms tend to appear mainly during exercise or tachyarrhythmias.\\nCoronary blood flow may be impaired, causing angina pectoris, syncope, or arrhythmias in the absenceof epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD). Flow may be impaired because capillary density relative tomyocyte size is inadequate (capillary/myocyte imbalance) or lumen diameter of intramyocardial coronaryarteries is narrowed by intimal and medial hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Also, exercise lowers peripheralvascular resistance and aortic root diastolic pressure, thus reducing coronary perfusion pressure.\\nIn some cases, myocytes gradually die, probably because capillary/myocyte imbalance causes chronicdiffuse ischemia. As myocytes die, they are replaced by diffuse fibrosis. Then, the hypertrophied ventriclewith diastolic dysfunction gradually dilates and systolic dysfunction also develops.\\nInfective endocarditis can complicate HCM because of the mitral valve abnormality and because of rapidblood flow through the outflow tract during early systole. Atrioventricular block is sometimes a latecomplication.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nTypically, symptoms appear between ages 20 and 40 and are exertional. They include dyspnea, chestpain (usually resembling typical angina—see p. 2090), palpitations, and syncope. Because systolicfunction is preserved, fatigability is seldom reported.\\nSyncope usually occurs without warning during exertion either because outflow obstruction worsens withthe increased contractility or because of nonsustained ventricular or atrial arrhythmia. Syncope is amarker of increased risk of sudden death, which is thought to result from ventricular tachycardia orfibrillation.\\nBP and heart rate are usually normal, and signs of increased venous pressure are rare. When the outflowtract is obstructed, the carotid pulse has a brisk upstroke, bifid peak, and rapid downstroke. The apexbeat may have a sustained thrust due to LV hypertrophy. A 4th heart sound (S4) is often present and isassociated with a forceful atrial contraction against a poorly compliant LV in late diastole.\\nSeptal hypertrophy produces a systolic ejection-type murmur that does not radiate to the neck and may\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 212.

A mitral regurgitation murmur due todistortion of the mitral apparatus may be heard at the apex. When the right ventricular outflow tract isnarrowed, a systolic ejection murmur is sometimes heard in the 2nd interspace at the left sternal border.The LV outflow ejection murmur of HCM can be increased by a Valsalva maneuver (which reducesvenous return and LV diastolic volume), by measures to lower aortic pressure (eg, nitroglycerin), or by apostextrasystolic contraction (which increases the outflow tract pressure gradient). Handgrip increasesaortic pressure, thereby reducing the murmur's intensity.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical suspicion (syncope and murmur)\\n• Echocardiography\\nDiagnosis is suspected based on a typical murmur and symptoms. Unexplained syncope in youngathletes should always raise suspicion. HCM must be distinguished from aortic stenosis and CAD, whichcause similar symptoms. ECG and 2-dimensional echocardiography (the best noninvasive confirmatorytest) are done. Chest x-ray is often taken but is usually normal because the ventricles are not dilated(although the left atrium may be enlarged). Patients with syncope or sustained arrhythmias should beevaluated as inpatients. Exercise testing and 24-h ambulatory monitoring may be helpful for patientsconsidered at high risk, although identifying such patients is difficult.\\nThe ECG usually shows voltage criteria for LV hypertrophy (eg, S wave in lead V1 plus R wave in lead V5or V6 > 35 mm). Very deep septal Q waves in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6 are often present with asymmetricseptal hypertrophy; HCM sometimes produces a QRS complex in V1 and V2, simulating previous septalinfarction. T waves are usually abnormal; the most common finding is deep symmetric T-wave inversion inleads I, aVL, V5, and V6. ST-segment depression in the same leads is common (particularly in the apicalobliterative form). The P wave is often broad and notched in leads II, III, and aVF, with a biphasic P wavein leads V1 and V2, indicating left atrial hypertrophy. Incidence of preexcitation phenomenon of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome type, which may cause palpitations, is increased. Bundle branch block iscommon.\\nTwo-dimensional Doppler echocardiography can differentiate the forms of cardiomyopathy (see Fig. 212-1) and quantify the degree of outflow tract obstruction, including pressure gradient and area of thestenotic segment. These measurements are particularly useful for monitoring the effect of medical orsurgical treatment. Midsystolic closure of the aortic valve sometimes occurs when outflow tractobstruction is severe.\\nCardiac catheterization is usually done only when invasive therapy is considered. Usually, no significantstenoses are present in the coronary arteries, but elderly patients may have coexisting CAD.\\nPrognosis\\nOverall, annual mortality is 1 to 3% for adults but is higher for children. Mortality rate is inverselyproportional to the age at which symptoms appear and is highest in patients who have frequentnonsustained ventricular tachycardia or syncope or have been resuscitated after sudden cardiac arrest.Prognosis is worse for young patients with a family history of sudden death and for patients > 45 yr withangina or exertional dyspnea. Death is usually sudden, and sudden death is the most common sequelae;chronic heart failure occurs less often. Genetic counseling is appropriate for patients with asymmetricseptal hypertrophy, which appears to accelerate during puberty.\\nTreatment\\n• β-Blockers\\n• Rate-limiting and negative inotropic Ca channel blockers\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 212.

By slowing the heart rate, theyprolong the diastolic filling period. Both effects decrease outflow obstruction, thus improving ventriculardiastolic function. In severe cases, disopyramide may be added for its negative inotropic effect.\\nDrugs that reduce preload (eg, nitrates, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers)decrease chamber size and worsen symptoms and signs. Vasodilators increase the outflow tract gradientand cause a reflex tachycardia that further worsens ventricular diastolic function. Inotropic drugs (eg,digitalis glycosides, catecholamines) worsen outflow tract obstruction, do not relieve the high end-diastolic pressure, and may induce arrhythmias.\\nIf syncope or sudden cardiac arrest has occurred or if ventricular arrhythmia is confirmed by ECG or 24-hambulatory monitoring, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or antiarrhythmics should be considered.Competitive sports should be avoided because many sudden deaths occur during increased exertion.\\nTreatment of the dilated congestive phase of HCM is the same as that of dilated cardiomyopathy withpredominant systolic dysfunction.\\nIf septal hypertrophy and outflow tract obstruction cause significant symptoms despite medical therapy,surgery is needed. Catheter alcohol ablation is variably effective but is becoming more widely used;surgical septal myotomy or myomectomy reduces symptoms more reliably but does not prolong life.\\nRestrictive Cardiomyopathy\\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is characterized by noncompliant ventricular walls that resistdiastolic filling; one or both ventricles, most commonly the left, may be affected.

Some disorders that cause RCM also affect other tissues (eg, amyloidosis,hemochromatosis). Some myocardial infiltrative disorders also affect other cardiac tissue. Rarely,amyloidosis affects coronary arteries. Sarcoidosis and Fabry's disease may also affect nodal conductiontissue. Loffler's syndrome (a subcategory of hypereosinophilic syndrome with primary cardiacinvolvement), which occurs in the tropics, begins as an acute arteritis with eosinophilia, followed bythrombus formation on the endocardium, chordae, and atrioventricular (AV) valves, progressing to fibrosis.Endocardial fibroelastosis, which occurs in temperate zones, affects only the left ventricle.\\nPathophysiology\\nEndocardial thickening or myocardial infiltration (sometimes with death of myocytes, papillary muscle\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 212.

As a result, the mitral or tricuspid valves may malfunction, leading to regurgitation. FunctionalAV valve regurgitation may result from myocardial infiltration or endocardial thickening. If nodal andconduction tissues are affected, the sinoatrial node malfunctions, sometimes causing various grades ofAV block.\\n[Table 212-3. Causes of Restrictive Cardiomyopathy]\\nThe main hemodynamic consequence is diastolic dysfunction (see p. 2120) with a rigid, noncompliantventricle, impaired diastolic filling, and high filling pressure, leading to pulmonary venous hypertension.Systolic function may deteriorate if compensatory hypertrophy of infiltrated or fibrosed ventricles isinadequate. Mural thrombi can form, resulting in systemic emboli.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSymptoms are exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and, when the right ventricle is affected, peripheral edema.Fatigue results from a fixed cardiac output due to resistance to ventricular filling. Atrial and ventriculararrhythmias and AV block are common; angina and syncope are uncommon. Symptoms and signs closelymimic those of constrictive pericarditis (see p. 2203).\\nPhysical examination detects a quiet precordium, a low-volume and rapid carotid pulse, pulmonarycrackles, and pronounced neck vein distention with a rapid y descent (seeFig. 206-1 on p.2020). A 4th heart sound (S4) is almost always present; a 3rd heart sound (S3) may occur and must bedifferentiated from the precordial knock of constrictive pericarditis. In some cases, a murmur of functionalmitral or tricuspid regurgitation results because myocardial or endocardial infiltration or fibrosis changeschordae or ventricular geometry. Pulsus paradoxus does not occur.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Echocardiography\\n• Testing for cause\\nECG, chest x-ray, and echocardiography are required. The ECG is usually nonspecifically abnormal,showing ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities and sometimes low voltage. Pathologic Q waves, not dueto previous MI, sometimes occur. Left ventricular hypertrophy due to compensatory myocardialhypertrophy sometimes occurs. On chest x-ray, the heart size is often normal or small but can be enlargedin late-stage amyloidosis or hemochromatosis.\\nEchocardiography shows normal systolic function. Common findings include dilated atria and myocardialhypertrophy. RCM due to amyloidosis has an unusually bright echo pattern from the myocardium.Echocardiography helps differentiate constrictive pericarditis with its thickened pericardium, butparadoxical septal motion can occur in either disorder. If the diagnosis is still in doubt, CT may be moresensitive in showing whether the pericardium is normal, and MRI can show abnormal myocardial texturein disorders with myocardial infiltration (eg, by amyloid or iron).\\nCardiac catheterization and myocardial biopsy are not often necessary. If done, catheterization detectshigh atrial pressure in RCM, with a prominent y descent and an early diastolic dip followed by a highdiastolic plateau in the ventricular pressure curve. In contrast to constrictive pericarditis findings, diastolicpressure is usually a few mm Hg higher in the left ventricle than in the right. Angiography detects normal-sized ventricular cavities with normal or decreased systolic shortening. AV valve regurgitation may bepresent. Biopsy can detect endocardial fibrosis and thickening, myocardial infiltration by iron or amyloid,and chronic myocardial fibrosis. Coronary angiography is normal, except when amyloidosis affectsepicardial coronary arteries. Occasionally, cardiac catheterization is not diagnostic, and rarely,thoracotomy is required to explore the pericardium.\\nTests for the most common causes of RCM (eg, rectal biopsy for amyloidosis, iron tests or liver biopsy for\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 212.

Arrhythmias and Conduction Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nThe normal heart beats in a regular, coordinated way because electrical impulses generated and spreadby myocytes with unique electrical properties trigger a sequence of organized myocardial contractions.Arrhythmias and conduction disorders are caused by abnormalities in the generation or conduction ofthese electrical impulses or both.\\nAny heart disorder, including congenital abnormalities of structure (eg, accessory atrioventricularconnection) or function (eg, hereditary ion channelopathies), can disturb rhythm. Systemic factors thatcan cause or contribute to a rhythm disturbance include electrolyte abnormalities (particularly low K orMg), hypoxia, hormonal imbalances (eg, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism), and drugs and toxins (eg,alcohol, caffeine).\\nAnatomy\\nAt the junction of the superior vena cava and high lateral right atrium is a cluster of cells that generatesthe initial electrical impulse of each normal heart beat, called the sinoatrial (SA) or sinus node. Electricaldischarge of these pacemaker cells stimulates adjacent cells, leading to stimulation of successive regionsof the heart in an orderly sequence. Impulses are transmitted through the atria to the atrioventricular (AV)node via preferentially conducting internodal tracts and unspecialized atrial myocytes. The AV node islocated on the right side of the interatrial septum. It has a slow conduction velocity and thus delaysimpulse transmission. AV nodal transmission time is heart-rate-dependent and is modulated by autonomictone and circulating catecholamines to maximize cardiac output at any given atrial rate.\\nThe atria are electrically insulated from the ventricles by the annulus fibrosus except in the anteroseptalregion. There, the bundle of His, the continuation of the AV node, enters the top of the interventricularseptum, where it bifurcates into the left and right bundle branches, which terminate in Purkinje fibers. Theright bundle branch conducts impulses to the anterior and apical endocardial regions of the right ventricle.The left bundle branch fans out over the left side of the interventricular septum. Its anterior portion (leftanterior hemifascicle) and its posterior portion (left posterior hemifascicle) stimulate the left side of theinterventricular septum, which is the first part of the ventricles to be electrically activated. Thus, theinterventricular septum depolarizes left to right, followed by near-simultaneous activation of bothventricles from the endocardial surface through the ventricular walls to the epicardial surface.\\nPhysiology\\nAn understanding of normal cardiac physiology is essential before rhythm disturbances can beunderstood.\\nElectrophysiology: The passage of ions across the myocyte cell membrane is regulated throughspecific ion channels that cause cyclical depolarization and repolarization of the cell, called an actionpotential. The action potential of a working myocyte begins when the cell is depolarized from its diastolic -90 mV transmembrane potential to a potential of about -50 mV. At this threshold potential, voltage-dependent fast Na channels open, causing rapid depolarization mediated by Na influx down its steepconcentration gradient. The fast Na channel is rapidly inactivated and Na influx stops, but other time- andvoltage-dependent ion channels open, allowing Ca to enter through slow Ca channels (a depolarizingevent) and K to leave through K channels (a repolarizing event). At first, these 2 processes are balanced,maintaining a positive transmembrane potential and prolonging the plateau phase of the action potential.During this phase, Ca entering the cell is responsible for electromechanical coupling and myocytecontraction. Eventually, Ca influx ceases, and K efflux increases, causing rapid repolarization of the cellback to the -90 mV resting transmembrane potential. While depolarized, the cell is resistant (refractory) toa subsequent depolarizing event. Initially, a subsequent depolarization is not possible (absolute refractoryperiod), and after partial but incomplete repolarization, a subsequent depolarization is possible but occursslowly (relative refractory period).\\nThere are 2 general types of cardiac tissue:\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 213.

Thus, the SA node is thedominant automatic tissue (pacemaker) in a normal heart. If the SA node does not produce impulses,tissue with the next highest automaticity rate, typically the AV node, functions as the pacemaker.Sympathetic stimulation increases the discharge frequency of pacemaker tissue, and parasympatheticstimulation decreases it.\\nNormal rhythm: The resting sinus heart rate in adults is usually 60 to 100 beats/min. Slower rates (sinusbradycardia) occur in young people, particularly athletes (see p. 2238), and during sleep. Faster rates(sinus tachycardia) occur with exercise, illness, or emotion through sympathetic neural and circulatingcatecholamine drive. Normally, a marked diurnal variation in heart rate occurs, with lowest rates justbefore early morning awakening. A slight increase in rate during inspiration with a decrease in rate duringexpiration (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) is also normal; it is mediated by oscillations in vagal tone and isparticularly common among healthy young people. The oscillations lessen but do not entirely disappearwith age. Absolute regularity of the sinus rhythm rate is pathologic and occurs in patients with autonomicdenervation (eg, in advanced diabetes) or with severe heart failure.\\nMost cardiac electrical activity is represented on the ECG (seeFig. 207-1 on p. 2050), although SA node, AV node, and His-Purkinje depolarization does not involveenough tissue to be detected. The P wave represents atrial depolarization. The QRS complex representsventricular depolarization, and the T wave represents ventricular repolarization.\\nThe PR interval (from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex) is the time fromthe beginning of atrial activation to the beginning of ventricular activation. Much of this interval reflectsslowing of impulse transmission in the AV node. The R-R interval (time between 2 QRS complexes)represents the ventricular rate. The QT interval (from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of theT wave) represents the duration of ventricular depolarization. Normal values for the QT interval areslightly longer in women; they are also longer with a slower heart rate. The QT interval is corrected (QTc)for influence of heart rate. The most common formula (all intervals in sec) is:\\nPathophysiology\\nRhythm disturbances result from abnormalities of impulse formation, impulse conduction, or both.Bradyarrhythmias result from decreased intrinsic pacemaker function or blocks in conduction, principallywithin the AV node or the His-Purkinje system.

Normally, reentry is prevented by tissue refractoriness following stimulation. However, 3conditions favor reentry: shortening of tissue refractoriness (eg, by sympathetic stimulation), lengtheningof the conduction pathway (eg, by hypertrophy or abnormal conduction pathways), and slowing ofimpulse conduction (eg, by ischemia).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nArrhythmia and conduction disturbances may be asymptomatic or cause palpitations (sensation ofskipped beats or rapid or forceful beats—see p. 2038), symptoms of hemo-dynamic compromise (eg,dyspnea, chest discomfort, presyncope, syncope), or cardiac arrest. Occasionally, polyuria results fromrelease of atrial natriuretic peptide during prolonged supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs).\\nPalpation of pulse and cardiac auscultation can determine ventricular rate and its regularity or irregularity.Examination of the jugular venous pulse waves may help in the diagnosis of AV blocks and atrialtachyarrhythmias. For example, in complete AV block, the atria intermittently contract when the AV valvesare closed, producing large a (cannon) waves in the jugular venous pulse (see p.2020). Other physical findings of arrhythmias are few.\\nDiagnosis\\n• ECG\\nHistory and physical examination may detect an arrhythmia and suggest possible causes, but diagnosisrequires a 12-lead ECG or, less reliably, a rhythm strip, preferably obtained during symptoms to establishthe relationship between symptoms and rhythm.\\nThe ECG is approached systematically; calipers measure intervals and identify subtle irregularities. Thekey diagnostic features are rate of atrial activation, rate and regularity of ventricular activation, and therelationship between the two. Irregular activation signals are classified as regularly irregular or irregularlyirregular (no detectible pattern). Regular irregularity is intermittent irregularity in an otherwise regularrhythm (eg, premature beats) or a predictable pattern of irregularity (eg, recurrent relationships betweengroups of beats).\\nA narrow QRS complex (< 0.12 sec) indicates a supraventricular origin (above the His\\n[Fig. 213-1.

A wide QRS complex (≥ 0.12 sec) indicates a ventricular origin (below the His bundlebifurcation) or a supraventricular rhythm conducted with an intraventricular conduction defect or withventricular preexcitation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.\\nBradyarrhythmias: ECG diagnosis of bradyarrhythmias depends on the presence or absence of Pwaves, morphology of the P waves, and the relationship between P waves and QRS complexes.\\nA bradyarrhythmia with no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes indicates AV dissociation;the escape rhythm can be junctional (narrow QRS complex) or ventricular (wide QRS complex).\\nA regular QRS rhythm with a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes indicates absence ofAV block. P waves preceding QRS complexes indicate sinus bradycardia (if P waves are normal) or sinusarrest with an escape atrial bradycardia (if P waves are abnormal). P waves after QRS complexesindicate sinus arrest with a junctional or ventricular escape rhythm and retrograde atrial activation.

An irregular QRSrhythm with a 1:1 relationship between P waves and the following QRS complexes usually indicates sinusarrhythmia with gradual acceleration and deceleration of the sinus rate (if P waves are normal).\\nPauses in an otherwise regular QRS rhythm may be caused by blocked P waves (an abnormal P wavecan usually be discerned just after the preceding T wave or distorting the morphology of the preceding Twave), sinus arrest, or sinus exit block (see p. 2161), as well as by 2nd-degree AV block.\\nTachyarrhythmias: Tachyarrhythmias may be divided into 4 groups, defined by being visibly regular vsirregular and by having a narrow vs wide QRS complex.\\nIrregular, narrow QRS complex tachyarrhythmias include atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter or true atrialtachycardia with variable AV conduction, and multifocal atrial tachycardia. Differentiation is based on atrialECG signals, which are best seen in the longer pauses between QRS complexes. Atrial ECG signals thatare continuous, irregular in timing and morphology, and very rapid (> 300/min) without discrete P wavesindicate AF. Discrete P waves that vary from beat to beat with at least 3 different morphologies suggestmultifocal atrial tachycardia. Regular, discrete, uniform atrial signals without intervening isoelectric periodssuggest atrial flutter.\\nIrregular, wide QRS complex tachyarrhythmias include the above 4 atrial tachyarrhythmias, conductedwith either bundle branch block or ventricular preexcitation, and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT).Differentiation is based on atrial ECG signals and the presence in polymorphic VT of a very rapid rate (>250/min).\\nRegular, narrow QRS complex tachyarrhythmias include sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter or true atrialtachycardia with a consistent AV conduction ratio, and paroxysmal SVTs (AV nodal reentrant SVT,orthodromic reciprocating AV tachycardia in the presence of an accessory AV connection, and SA nodalreentrant SVT). Vagal maneuvers or pharmacologic AV nodal blockade can help distinguish among thesetachycardias. With these maneuvers, sinus tachycardia is not terminated, but it slows or AV blockdevelops, disclosing normal P waves. Similarly, atrial flutter and true atrial tachycardia are usually notterminated, but AV block discloses flutter waves or abnormal P waves. The most common forms ofparoxysmal SVT (AV nodal reentry and orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia) must terminate if AV blockoccurs.\\nRegular, wide QRS complex tachyarrhythmias include those listed for a regular, narrow QRS complextachyarrhythmia, each with bundle branch block or ventricular pre-excitation, and monomorphic VT. Vagalmaneuvers can help distinguish among them. ECG criteria to distinguish between VT and SVT with anintraventricular conduction defect have been proposed (seeTable 213-1). When in doubt, the rhythm is assumed to be VT because some drugs for SVTs can worsenthe clinical state if the rhythm is VT; however, the reverse is not true.\\nTreatment\\n• Treatment of cause\\n• Sometimes antiarrhythmic drugs, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and pacemakers\\nThe need for treatment varies; it is guided by symptoms and risks of the arrhythmia.

If necessary, direct antiarrhythmic therapy, including anti-arrhythmicdrugs, cardioversion-defibrillation, pacemakers, or a combination, is used. Patients with arrhythmias thathave caused or are likely to cause symptoms of hemodynamic compromise may have to be restrictedfrom driving until response to treatment has been assessed.\\nDrugs for Arrhythmias\\nMost antiarrhythmic drugs are grouped into 4 main classes (Vaughan Williams classification) based ontheir dominant cellular electrophysiologic effect (seeTable 213-2). Digoxin and adenosine are not included in the Vaughan Williams classification. Digoxinshortens atrial and ventricular refractory periods and is vagotonic, thereby prolonging AV nodalconduction and AV nodal refractory periods. Adenosine slows or blocks AV nodal conduction and canterminate tachyarrhythmias that rely upon AV nodal conduction for their perpetuation.\\nClass I: Na channel blockers (membrane-stabilizing drugs) block fast Na channels, slowing conduction infast-channel tissues (working atrial and ventricular myocytes, His-Purkinje system). In the ECG, this effectmay be reflected as widening of the P wave, widening of the QRS complex, prolongation of the PRinterval, or a combination.\\nClass I drugs are subdivided based on the kinetics of the Na channel effects. Class Ib drugs have fastkinetics, class Ic drugs have slow kinetics, and class Ia drugs have intermediate kinetics. The kinetics ofNa channel blockade determine the heart rates at which their electrophysiologic effects become manifest.Because class Ib drugs have fast kinetics, they express their electrophysiologic effects only at fast heartrates. Thus, an ECG obtained during normal rhythm at normal rates usually shows no evidence of fast-channel tissue conduction slowing. Class Ib drugs are not very potent antiarrhythmics and have minimaleffects on atrial tissue. Because class Ic drugs have slow kinetics, they express their electrophysiologiceffects at all heart rates. Thus, an ECG obtained during normal rhythm at normal heart rates usuallyshows fast-channel tissue conduction slowing. Class Ic drugs are more potent antiarrhythmics. Becauseclass Ia drugs have intermediate kinetics, their fast-channel tissue conduction slowing effects may or maynot be evident on an ECG obtained during normal rhythm at normal rates. Class Ia drugs also blockrepolarizing K channels, prolonging the refractory periods of fast-channel tissues. On the ECG, this effectis reflected as QT-interval prolongation even at normal rates. Class Ib drugs and class Ic drugs do notblock K channels directly.\\nThe primary indications are SVTs for class Ia and Ic drugs and VTs for all class I drugs. The mostworrisome adverse effect is proarrhythmia, a drug-related arrhythmia worse than the arrhythmia beingtreated. Class Ia drugs may cause torsades de pointes VT; class Ia and class Ic drugs may organize andslow atrial tachyarrhythmias enough to permit 1:1 AV conduction with marked acceleration of theventricular response rate. All class I drugs may worsen VTs. They also tend to depress ventricularcontractility. Because these adverse effects are more likely to occur in patients with a structural heartdisorder, class I drugs are not generally recommended for such patients. Thus, these drugs are usuallyused only in patients who do not have a structural heart disorder or in patients who have a structuralheart disorder but who have no other therapeutic alternatives.\\nClass II: Class II drugs are β-blockers, which affect predominantly slow-channel tissues (SA and AVnodes), where they decrease rate of automaticity, slow conduction velocity, and prolong refractoriness.Thus, heart rate is slowed, the PR interval is lengthened, and the AV node transmits rapid atrialdepolarizations at a lower frequency. Class II drugs are used primarily to treat SVTs, including sinustachycardia, AV nodal reentry, AF, and atrial flutter. These drugs are also used to treat VTs to raise thethreshold for ventricular fibrillation (VF) and reduce the ventricular proarrhythmic effects of β-adrenoceptor stimulation. β-Blockers are generally well tolerated; adverse effects include lassitude, sleepdisturbance, and GI upset. These drugs are contraindicated in patients with asthma.\\nClass III: Class III drugs are primarily K channel blockers, which prolong action potential duration andrefractoriness in slow-and fast-channel tissues. Thus, the capacity of all cardiac tissues to transmitimpulses at high frequencies is reduced, but conduction velocity is not significantly affected.

Heart rate is slowed, the PR interval is lengthened, and the AV nodetransmits rapid atrial depolarizations at a lower frequency. These drugs are used primarily to treat SVTs.\\nDevices and Procedures\\nDirect-current (DC) cardioversiondefibrillation: A transthoracic DC shock of sufficient magnitudedepolarizes the entire myocardium, rendering the entire heart momentarily refractory to repeatdepolarization. Thereafter, the most rapid intrinsic pacemaker, usually the SA node, reassumes control ofheart rhythm. Thus, DC cardioversion-defibrillation very effectively terminates tachyarrhythmias that resultfrom reentry. However, it is less effective for terminating tachyarrhythmias that result from automaticitybecause the return rhythm is likely to be the automatic tachyarrhythmia. For tachyarrhythmias other thanVF, the DC shock must be synchronized to the QRS complex (called DC cardioversion) because a shockthat falls during the vulnerable period (near the peak of the T wave) can induce VF. In VF, synchronizationof a shock to the QRS complex is neither necessary nor possible. A DC shock applied withoutsynchronization to a QRS complex is DC defibrillation.\\nWhen DC cardioversion is elective, patients should fast for 6 to 8 h to avoid the possibility of aspiration.Because the procedure is frightening and painful, brief general anesthesia or IV analgesia and sedation(eg, fentanyl 1 μg/kg, then midazolam 1 to 2 mg q 2 min to a maximum of 5 mg) is necessary. Equipmentand personnel to maintain the airways must be present.\\nThe electrodes (pads or paddles) used for cardioversion may be placed anteroposteriorly (along the leftsternal border over the 3rd and 4th intercostal spaces and in the left infrascapular region) oranterolaterally (between the clavicle and the 2nd intercostal space along the right sternal border and overthe 5th and 6th intercostal spaces at the apex of the heart). After synchronization to the QRS complex isconfirmed on the monitor, a shock is given. The most appropriate energy level varies with thetachyarrhythmia being treated. Cardioversion efficacy increases with use of biphasic shocks, in which thecurrent polarity is reversed part way through the shock waveform. Complications are usually minor andinclude atrial and ventricular premature beats and muscle soreness. Less commonly, but more likely ifpatients have marginal left ventricular function or multiple shocks are used, cardioversion precipitatesmyocyte damage and electromechanical dissociation.\\nDC cardioversion-defibrillation can also be applied directly to the heart during a thoracotomy or throughuse of an intracardiac electrode catheter; then, much lower energy levels are required.\\nPacemakers: Pacemakers sense electrical events and respond when necessary by delivering electricalstimuli to the heart. Permanent pacemaker leads are placed via thoracotomy or transvenously, but sometemporary emergency pacemaker leads can be placed on the chest wall.\\nIndications are numerous (seeTable 213-3) but generally involve symptomatic bradycardia or high-grade AV block. Sometachyarrhythmias may be terminated by over-drive pacing with a brief period of pacing at a faster rate; thepacemaker is then slowed to the desired rate. Nevertheless, ventricular tachyarrhythmias are bettertreated with devices that can cardiovert and defibrillate as well as pace (implantable cardioverterdefibrillators).\\nTypes of pacemakers are designated by 3 to 5 letters (seeTable 213-4), representing which cardiac chambers are paced, which chambers are sensed, how the\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 213.

For example, a VVIR pacemaker paces (V) and senses (V)events in the ventricle, inhibits pacing in response to sensed event (I), and can increase its rate duringexercise (R).\\nVVI and DDD pacemakers are the devices most commonly used. They offer equivalent survival benefits.Compared with VVI pacemakers, physiologic pacemakers (AAI, DDD, VDD) appear to reduce risk of AFand heart failure and slightly improve quality of life.\\nAdvances in pacemaker design include lower-energy circuitry, new battery designs, and corticosteroid-eluting leads (which reduce pacing threshold), all of which increase pacemaker longevity. Mode switchingrefers to an automatic change in the mode of pacing in response to sensed events (eg, from DDDR toVVIR during AF).\\nPacemakers may malfunction by oversensing or undersensing events, failing to pace or\\n[Table 213-3. Indications for Permanent Pacemakers]\\n[Table 213-4. Pacemaker Codes]\\ncapture, or pacing at an abnormal rate. Tachycardias are an especially common complication. Rate-modulating pacemakers may increase stimuli in response to vibration, muscle activity, or voltage inducedby magnetic fields during MRI. In pacemaker-mediated tachycardia, a normally functioning dual-chamberpacemaker senses a ventricular premature or paced beat transmitted to the atrium through the AV node ora retrograde-conducting accessory pathway, which triggers ventricular stimulation in a rapid, repeatingcycle.\\nAdditional complications associated with normally functioning devices include crosstalk inhibition, in whichsensing of the atrial pacing impulse by the ventricular channel of a dual-chamber pacemaker leads toinhibition of ventricular pacing, and pacemaker syndrome, in which AV asynchrony induced by ventricularpacing causes fluctuating, vague cerebral (eg, light-headedness), cervical (eg, neck pulsations), orrespiratory (eg, dyspnea) symptoms. Pacemaker syndrome is managed by restoring AV synchrony byatrial pacing (AAI), single-lead atrial sensing ventricular pacing (VDD), or dual-chamber pacing (DDD),most commonly the latter.\\nEnvironmental interference comes from electromagnetic sources such as surgical electrocautery and MRI,although MRI may be safe when the pacemaker generator and leads are not inside the magnet. Cellulartelephones and electronic security devices are a potential source of interference; telephones should notbe placed close to the device but are not a problem when used normally for talking. Walking throughmetal detectors does not cause pacemaker malfunction as long as patients do not linger.\\nComplications during implantation are uncommon but may include myocardial perforation, bleeding, andpneumothorax. Postoperative complications include infection, lead migration, and impulse generatormigration.\\nImplantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs): ICDs cardiovert or defibrillate the heart in response toVT or VF. Contemporary tiered-therapy ICDs also provide antibradycardia pacing and antitachycardiapacing (to terminate responsive atrial or ventricular tachycardias) and store intracardiac electrograms.ICDs are implanted subcutaneously or subpectorally, with electrodes inserted transvenously into the rightventricle and sometimes also the right atrium.

ICDs may malfunction by delivering inappropriatepacing or shocks in response to sinus rhythm or SVTs or by not delivering appropriate pacing or shockswhen needed. Causes include lead or impulse generator migration, undersensing and an\\n[Table 213-5.

The ICD can then be electronically interrogated to determine the reason fordischarge. If such associated symptoms were present, or the patient received multiple shocks, emergencydepartment referral is indicated to look for a treatable cause (eg, coronary ischemia, electrolyteabnormality) or device malfunction.\\nRadiofrequency (RF) ablation: If a tachyarrhythmia depends on a specific pathway or ectopic site ofautomaticity, the site can be ablated by low-voltage, high-frequency (300 to 750 MHz) electrical energy,applied through an electrode catheter. This energy heats and necroses an area < 1 cm in diameter andup to 1 cm deep. Before energy can be applied, the target site or sites must be mapped during anelectrophysiologic study (see p. 2058).\\nSuccess rate is > 90% for reentrant tachycardias (via the AV node or an accessory pathway), focal atrialtachycardia and flutter, and focal idiopathic VTs (right ventricular outflow tract, left septal, or bundlebranch reentrant VT). Because AF often originates or is maintained by an arrhythmogenic site in thepulmonary veins, this site can be ablated directly or, more commonly, electrically isolated by ablations atthe pulmonary vein-left atrial junction or in the left atrium. Alternatively, in patients with refractory AF andrapid ventricular rates, the AV node may be ablated after permanent pacemaker implantation. RF ablationis sometimes successful in patients with VT refractory to drugs and with ischemic heart disease.\\nRF ablation is safe; mortality is < 1/2000. Complications include valvular damage, pulmonary veinstenosis or occlusion (if used to treat atrial fibrillation), stroke or other embolism, cardiac perforation,tamponade (1%), and unintended AV node ablation.\\nSurgery: Surgery to remove a focus of a tachyarrhythmia is becoming less necessary as the lessinvasive RF ablation techniques evolve. But it is still indicated when an arrhythmia is refractory to RFablation or when another indication requires a cardiac surgical procedure, most commonly when patientswith AF require valve replacement or repair or when patients with VT require revascularization orresection of a left ventricular aneurysm.\\nSinus Node Dysfunction\\n(Sick Sinus Syndrome)\\nSinus node dysfunction refers to a number of conditions causing physiologically inappropriateatrial rates. Symptoms may be minimal or include weakness, palpitations, and syncope.Diagnosis is by ECG. Symptomatic patients require a pacemaker.\\nSinus node dysfunction includes inappropriate sinus bradycardia, alternating bradycardia and atrialtachyarrhythmias (bradycardiatachycardia syndrome), sinus pause or arrest, and sinoatrial (SA) exitblock.

The pause usually triggers escape activity in lower pacemakers (eg, atrial orjunctional), preserving heart rate and function, but long pauses cause dizziness and syncope.\\nIn SA exit block, the SA node depolarizes, but conduction of impulses to atrial tissue is impaired. In 1st-degree SA block, the SA node impulse is merely slowed, and ECG is normal. In type I 2nd-degree SA (SAWenckebach) block, impulse conduction slows before blocking, seen on the ECG as a P-P interval thatdecreases progressively until the P wave drops altogether, creating a pause and the appearance ofgrouped beats; the duration of the pause is less than 2 P-P cycles. In type II 2nd-degree SA block,conduction of impulses is blocked without slowing beforehand, producing a pause that is a multiple(usually twice) of the P-P interval and the appearance of grouped beats. In 3rd-degree SA block,conduction is blocked; P waves are absent, giving the appearance of sinus arrest.\\nThe most common cause of sinus node dysfunction is idiopathic SA node fibrosis, which may beaccompanied by degeneration of lower elements of the conducting system. Other causes include drugs,excessive vagal tone, and many ischemic, inflammatory, and infiltrative disorders.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMany patients are asymptomatic, but depending on the heart rate, all the symptoms of bradycardias andtachycardias can occur (see p. 2144).\\nDiagnosis\\nA slow, irregular pulse suggests the diagnosis, which is confirmed by ECG, rhythm strip, or continuous24-h ECG recording. Some patients present with atrial fibrillation (AF), and the underlying sinus nodedysfunction manifests only after conversion to sinus rhythm.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis is mixed; without treatment, mortality is about 2%/yr, primarily resulting from an underlyingstructural heart disorder. Each year, about 5% of patients develop AF with its risks of heart failure andstroke.\\nTreatment\\n• Pacemaker\\nTreatment is pacemaker implantation. Risk of AF is greatly reduced when a physiologic (atrial or atrial andventricular) pacemaker rather than a ventricular pacemaker is used. Newer dual chamber pacemakersthat minimize ventricular pacing may further reduce risk of AF. Antiarrhythmic drugs may preventparoxysmal tachyarrhythmias after pacemaker insertion.

They maybe single or multiple; escape beats from a single focus may produce a continuous rhythm (called ectopicatrial rhythm). Heart rate is typically slower, P wave morphology is typically different, and PR interval isslightly shorter than in sinus rhythm.\\nWandering atrial pacemaker: Wandering atrial pacemaker (multifocal atrial rhythm) is an irregularlyirregular rhythm caused by the random discharge of multiple ectopic atrial foci. By definition, heart rate is≤ 100 beats/min. This arrhythmia most typically occurs in patients who have a pulmonary disorder and arehypoxic, acidotic, theophylline-intoxicated, or a combination. On ECG, P-wave morphology differs frombeat to beat, and there are ≥ 3 distinct P-wave morphologies. The presence of P waves distinguisheswandering atrial pacemaker from atrial fibrillation.\\nMultifocal atrial tachycardia: Multifocal atrial tachycardia (chaotic atrial tachycardia) is an irregularlyirregular rhythm caused by the random discharge of multiple ectopic atrial foci. By definition, heart rate is> 100 beats/min. Except for the rate, features are the same as those of wandering atrial pacemaker.Symptoms, when they occur, are those of rapid tachycardia. Treatment is directed at the underlyingpulmonary disorder.\\nAtrial tachycardia: Atrial tachycardia is a regular rhythm caused by the consistent, rapid atrial activationfrom a single atrial focus. Heart rate is usually 150 to 200 beats/min; however, with a very rapid atrial rate,nodal dysfunction, or digitalis toxicity, atrioventricular (AV) block may be present, and ventricular rate maybe slower. Mechanisms include enhanced atrial automaticity and intra-atrial reentry. Atrial tachycardia isthe least common form (5%) of supraventricular tachycardia and\\n[Fig. 213-3. Atrial premature beat (APB).]\\n[Fig. 213-4. True atrial tachycardia.]\\nusually occurs in patients with a structural heart disorder. Other causes include atrial irritation (eg,pericarditis), drugs (eg, digoxin), alcohol, and toxic gas inhalation. Symptoms are those of othertachycardias. Diagnosis is by ECG; P waves, which differ in morphology from normal sinus P waves,precede QRS complexes but may be hidden within the preceding T wave (see Fig. 213-4).\\nVagal maneuvers may be used to slow the heart rate, allowing visualization of P waves when they arehidden, but these maneuvers do not usually terminate the arrhythmia (demonstrating that the AV node isnot an obligate part of the arrhythmia circuit). Treatment involves managing causes and slowingventricular response rate using a β-blocker or Ca channel blocker. An episode may be terminated bydirect-current cardioversion. Pharmacologic approaches to termination and prevention of atrialtachycardia include antiarrhythmic drugs in class Ia, Ic, or III. If these noninvasive measures areineffective, alternatives include overdrive pacing and radiofrequency ablation.\\nNonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia: Nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia is caused by abnormalautomaticity in the AV node or adjacent tissue, which typically follows open heart surgery, acute inferiorMI, myocarditis, or digitalis toxicity. Heart rate is 60 to 120 beats/min; thus, symptoms are usually absent.ECG shows regular, normal-appearing QRS complexes without identifiable P waves or with retrograde Pwaves (inverted in the inferior leads) that occur shortly before (< 0.1 sec) or after the QRS complex. Therhythm is distinguished from paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia by the lower heart rate and gradualonset and offset. Treatment is directed at causes.\\nAtrioventricular Block\\nAtrioventricular (AV) block is partial or complete interruption of impulse transmission from theatria to the ventricles.

Risk of complete AV block is difficult to predict, and a pacemakeris indicated.\\nPatients with any form of 2nd-degree AV block and a structural heart disorder should be consideredcandidates for permanent pacing unless there is a transient or reversible cause.\\nThird-degree AV block: Heart block is complete (see Fig. 213-9).\\nThere is no electrical communication between the atria and ventricles and no relationship between Pwaves and QRS complexes (AV dissociation). Cardiac function is maintained by an escape junctional orventricular pacemaker. Escape rhythms originating above the bifurcation of the His bundle producenarrow QRS complexes, relatively rapid (> 40 beats/min) and reliable heart rates, and mild symptoms (eg,fatigue, postural light-headedness, effort intolerance). Escape rhythms originating below the bifurcationproduce wider QRS complexes, slower and unreliable heart rates, and more severe symptoms (eg,presyncope, syncope, heart failure). Signs include those of AV dissociation, such as cannon a waves, BPfluctuations, and changes in loudness of the 1st heart sound (S1). Risk of asystole-related syncope andsudden death is greater if low escape rhythms are present.\\nMost patients require a pacemaker (see Table 213-4). If the block is caused by anti-arrhythmic drugs,stopping the drug may be effective, although temporary pacing may be needed. A block caused by acuteinferior MI usually reflects AV nodal dysfunction and may respond to atropine or resolve spontaneouslyover several days. A block caused by anterior MI usually reflects extensive myocardial necrosis involvingthe His-Purkinje system and requires immediate transvenous pacemaker insertion with interim externalpacing as necessary. Spontaneous resolution may occur but warrants evaluation of AV nodal andinfranodal conduction (eg, electrophysiologic study, exercise testing, 24-h ECG).\\nMost patients with congenital 3rd-degree AV block have a junctional escape rhythm that maintains areasonable rate, but they require a permanent pacemaker before they reach middle age. Less commonly,patients with congenital AV block have a slow escape rhythm and require a permanent pacemaker at ayoung age, perhaps even during infancy.\\nAtrial Fibrillation\\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a rapid, irregularly irregular atrial rhythm. Symptoms include palpitationsand sometimes weakness, dyspnea, and presyncope. Atrial thrombi often form, causing asignificant risk of embolic stroke. Diagnosis is by ECG. Treatment involves rate control withdrugs, prevention of thromboembolism with anticoagulation, and sometimes conversion tosinus rhythm by drugs or cardioversion.\\nAF has been attributed to multiple wave-lets with chaotic reentry within the atria. However, in many cases,firing of an ectopic focus within venous structures adjacent to the atria (usually the pulmonary veins) isresponsible for initiation and perhaps maintenance of AF. In AF, the atria do not contract, and theatrioventricular (AV) conduction system is bombarded with many electrical stimuli, causing inconsistentimpulse transmission and an irregularly irregular ventricular rate, which is usually in the tachycardia raterange.\\nAF is one of the most common arrhythmias, affecting about 2.3 million adults in the US. Men and whitesare more likely to have AF than women and blacks. Prevalence increases with age; almost 10% of people> 80 yr are affected. It tends to occur in patients with a heart disorder, sometimes precipitating heartfailure because cardiac output decreases. The absent atrial contractions predispose to thrombusformation; annual risk of cerebrovascular embolic events is about 7%. Risk of stroke is higher in patientswith a rheumatic valvular disorder, hyperthyroidism, hypertension, diabetes, left ventricular systolicdysfunction, or previous thromboembolic events. Systemic emboli can also cause malfunction or necrosisof other organs (eg, heart, kidneys, GI tract, eyes) or a limb.\\nEtiology\\nThe most common causes are hypertension, ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy, mitral or tricuspid\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 213.

Less common causesinclude pulmonary embolism, atrial septal and other congenital heart defects, COPD, myocarditis, andpericarditis. AF without an identifiable cause in patients < 60 yr is called lone AF.\\nClassification\\nAcute AF is new-onset AF lasting < 48 h.\\nParoxysmal AF is recurrent AF that typically lasts < 48 h and that converts spontaneously to normal sinusrhythm.\\nPersistent AF lasts > 1 wk and requires treatment to convert to normal sinus rhythm.\\nPermanent AF cannot be converted to sinus rhythm. The longer AF is present, the less likely isspontaneous conversion and the more difficult is cardioversion because of atrial remodeling (rapid atrialrate-induced changes in atrial electrophysiology that are dominated by a decrease in atrial refractorinessand may also include increase in spatial dispersion of atrial refractoriness slowed atrial conductionvelocity, or both).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAF is often asymptomatic, but many patients have palpitations, vague chest discomfort, or symptoms ofheart failure (eg, weakness, light-headedness, dyspnea), particularly when the ventricular rate is veryrapid (often 140 to 160 beats/min). Patients may also present with symptoms and signs of acute stroke orof other organ damage due to systemic emboli.\\nThe pulse is irregularly irregular with loss of a waves in the jugular venous pulse. A pulse deficit (theapical ventricular rate is faster than the rate palpated at the wrist) may be present because left ventricularstroke volume is not always sufficient to produce a peripheral pressure wave at fast ventricular rates.\\nDiagnosis\\n• ECG\\n• Echocardiography\\n• Thyroid function tests\\nDiagnosis is by ECG. Findings include absence of P waves, f (fibrillatory) waves between QRScomplexes (irregular in timing, irregular in morphology; baseline undulations at rates > 300/min not alwaysapparent in all leads), and irregularly irregular R-R intervals (seeFig. 213-10).\\nOther irregular rhythms may resemble AF on ECG but can be distinguished by the presence of discrete Por flutter waves, which can sometimes be made more visible with vagal maneuvers. Muscle tremor orelectrical interference may resemble f waves, but the underlying rhythm is regular. AF may also cause aphenomenon that mimics ventricular extrasystoles or ventricular tachycardia (Ashman phenomenon). Thisphenomenon typically occurs when a short R-R interval follows a long R-R interval; the longer intervallengthens the refractory period of the infra-Hisian conduction system, and subsequent QRS complexesare conducted aberrantly, typically with right bundle branch morphology.\\nEchocardiography and thyroid function tests are important in the initial evaluation. Echocardiography isdone to assess structural heart defects (eg, left atrial enlargement, left ventricular wall motionabnormalities suggesting past or present ischemia, valvular disorders, cardiomyopathy) and to identifyadditional risk factors for stroke (eg, atrial blood stasis or thrombus, complex aortic plaque). Atrial thrombiare more likely in the atrial appendages, where they are best detected by transesophageal rather thantransthoracic echocardiography.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 213.

Atrial fibrillation.]\\nother symptoms suggest the need for it. Once causes have been managed, treatment of AF focuses onventricular rate control, rhythm control, and prevention of thromboembolism.\\nVentricular rate control: Patients with AF of any duration require rate control (typically to < 80 beats/minat rest) to control symptoms and prevent tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.\\nFor acute paroxysms of rapid rate (eg, 140 to 160 beats/min), IV AV node blockers are used (for doses,see Table 213-2). CAUTION: AV node blockers should not be used in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome when an accessory AV pathway is involved (indicated by wide QRS duration); thesedrugs increase frequency of conduction via the bypass tract, possibly causing ventricular fibrillation. β-Blockers (eg, metoprolol, esmolol) are preferred if excess catecholamines are suspected (eg, in thyroiddisorders, exercise-triggered cases). Nondihydropyridine Ca channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem)are also effective. Digoxin is the least effective but may be preferred if heart failure is present. Thesedrugs may be used orally for long-term rate control. When β-blockers, nondihydropyridine Ca channelblockers, and digoxin—separately or in combination—are ineffective, amiodarone may be required.\\nRhythm control: In patients with heart failure or other hemodynamic compromise directly attributable tonew-onset AF, restoration of normal sinus rhythm is indicated to improve cardiac output. In other cases,conversion of AF to normal sinus rhythm is optimal, but the antiarrhythmic drugs that are capable of doingso (class Ia, Ic, III) have a risk of adverse effects and may increase mortality. Conversion to sinus rhythmdoes not necessarily eliminate the need for chronic anticoagulation.\\nFor acute conversion, synchronized cardioversion or drugs can be used. Before conversion is attempted,the ventricular rate should be controlled to < 120 beats/min, and, if AF has been present > 48 h, patientsshould be given anticoagulants (conversion, regardless of method used, increases risk ofthromboembolism). Anticoagulation with warfarin (see p. 2168) should be maintained for > 3 wk beforeconversion when possible and continued indefinitely because AF may recur. Alternatively, the patient canbe anticoagulated with heparin, and transesophageal echocardiography done; if there is no intra-atrialclot, cardioversion can be done immediately.\\nSynchronized cardioversion (100 joules, followed by 200 and 360 joules as needed) converts AF tonormal sinus rhythm in 75 to 90% of patients, although recurrence rate is high. Efficacy and maintenanceof sinus rhythm after the procedure is improved with use of class Ia, Ic, or III drugs 24 to 48 h before theprocedure. Cardioversion is more effective in patients with shorter duration of AF, lone AF, or AF with areversible cause; it is less effective when the left atrium is enlarged (> 5 cm), atrial appendage flow is low,or a significant underlying structural heart disorder is present.\\nDrugs for conversion to sinus rhythm include class Ia (procainamide, quinidine, disopyramide), Ic(flecainide, propafenone), and III (amiodarone, dofetilide, ibutilide, sotalol) antiarrhythmics (see Table 213-2). All are effective in about 50 to 60% of patients, but adverse effects differ. These drugs should not beused until rate has been controlled by a βblocker or nondihydropyridine Ca channel blocker. Theseconverting drugs are also used for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm (with or without previouscardioversion). Choice depends on patient tolerance.

This approach must be limited to patients whohave no sinoatrial or AV node dysfunction, bundle branch block, QT prolongation, Brugada syndrome, orstructural heart disease. Its hazard (estimated at 1%) is the possibility of converting AF to a slowish atrialflutter that conducts 1:1 in the 200 to 240 beat/min range.\\nACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and aldosterone blockers may attenuate the myocardialfibrosis that provides a substrate for AF in patients with heart failure, but the role of these drugs in routineAF treatment has yet to be defined.\\nAblation procedures: For patients who do not respond to or cannot take rate-controlling drugs,radiofrequency ablation of the AV node may be done to produce complete heart block; insertion of apermanent pacemaker is then necessary. Ablation of only one AV nodal pathway (AV node modification)reduces the number of atrial impulses reaching the ventricles and eliminates the need for a pacemaker,but this approach is considered less effective than complete ablation and is rarely used.\\nAblation procedures that isolate the pulmonary veins from the left atrium can prevent AF withoutproducing AV block. In comparison to other ablation procedures, pulmonary vein isolation has a lowersuccess rate (60 to 80%) and a higher complication rate (1 to 5%). Accordingly, this procedure is oftenreserved for the best candidates—younger patients with drug-resistant AF who have no significantstructural heart disease.\\nPrevention of thromboembolism: Measures to prevent thromboembolism are necessary at the time ofcardioversion and during long-term treatment of most patients.\\nWarfarin titrated to an INR of 2 to 3 should be given for ≥ 3 wk before elective cardioversion of lone AFpresent for > 48 h and continued for 4 wk after successful cardioversion. Anticoagulants should becontinued indefinitely for patients with recurrent paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent AF in the presenceof risk factors for thromboembolism. Healthy patients with a single episode of lone AF are givenanticoagulants for 4 wk.\\nAspirin is less effective than warfarin but is used for patients with no risk factors for thromboembolism orthose with contraindications to warfarin. Direct thrombin inhibitors that do not require INR monitoring maybe equivalent to warfarin for stroke prevention in high-risk patients, but they require further study beforebeing recommended for mainstream use. The left atrial appendage may be surgically ligated or closedwith a transcatheter device when warfarin and antiplatelet drugs are absolutely contraindicated.\\nAtrial Flutter\\nAtrial flutter is a rapid regular atrial rhythm due to an atrial macro-reentrant circuit. Symptomsare mainly palpitations. Atrial thrombi may form and embolize. Diagnosis is by ECG. Treatmentinvolves rate control with drugs, prevention of thromboembolism with anticoagulants, and oftenconversion to sinus rhythm with drugs or cardioversion.\\nAtrial flutter is much less common than atrial fibrillation, but its causes and hemodynamic consequencesare similar. Many patients with atrial flutter also have periods of atrial fibrillation.\\nClassical atrial flutter is due to a large reentrant circuit involving most of the right atrium. The atriadepolarize at a rate of 250 to 350/min (typically 300/min). Because the atrioventricular (AV) node cannotusually conduct at this rate, typically half of the impulses get through (2:1 block), resulting in a regularventricular rate of 150 beats/min. Sometimes the block varies from moment to moment, causing anirregular ventricular rhythm. Less commonly, a fixed 3:1, 4:1, or 5:1 block may be present.\\nThe probability of a thromboembolic event, once considered rare in atrial flutter, is now thought to be\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 213.

Ifventricular rate is < 120 beats/min and regular, there are likely to be few or no symptoms. Faster ratesand variable AV conduction usually cause palpitations, and decreased cardiac output may causesymptoms of hemodynamic compromise (eg, chest discomfort, dyspnea, weakness, syncope). Closeinspection of the jugular venous pulse reveals flutter a waves.\\nDiagnosis\\n• ECG\\nThe diagnosis is by ECG, which shows continuous and regular atrial activation with a sawtooth pattern,most obvious in leads II, III, and aVF (seeFig. 213-11).\\nCarotid sinus massage can increase AV block and better expose the typical flutter waves. A similarresponse may follow pharmacologic AV nodal blockade (eg, with adenosine), but such therapy does notterminate atrial flutter.\\nTreatment\\n• Rate control with drugs\\n• Rhythm control with cardioversion, drugs, or ablation\\n• Prevention of thromboembolism\\nAs for atrial fibrillation, treatment focuses on ventricular rate control, rhythm control, and prevention ofthromboembolism. However, pharmacologic rate control is more difficult to achieve in atrial flutter than inatrial fibrillation. Thus for most patients, electrical conversion (using synchronized cardioversion oroverdrive pacing) is the treatment of choice for an initial episode and is mandatory with 1:1 AV conductionor hemodynamic compromise. Typically, low-energy (50 joules) conversion is effective. Anticoagulation, asin atrial fibrillation, is necessary before cardioversion.\\nIf drugs are used to restore sinus rhythm, rate must first be controlled with β-blockers ornondihydropyridine Ca channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem). Many of the antiarrhythmics that canrestore sinus rhythm (especially class Ia and Ic) can slow atrial flutter, shorten AV nodal refractoriness (bytheir vagolytic effects), or do both enough to allow 1:1 conduction with paradoxical increase in ventricularrate and hemodynamic compromise. These drugs may be used for long-term maintenance as required toprevent recurrence.\\nAn antitachycardia pacing system is an alternative to long-term use of antiarrhythmics in selectedpatients. Also, ablation procedures designed to interrupt the atrial reentrant circuit may effectively preventatrial flutter, particularly classic atrial flutter.\\nPatients with chronic or recurrent atrial flutter require warfarin (to maintain an INR of 2 to 3) or aspirintherapy long-term. The choice between the 2 therapies is based on the same considerations as for atrialfibrillation.\\n[Fig. 213-11.

It is most commonlytriggered by an atrial premature beat.\\nAccessory pathway reentrant tachycardia involves tracts of conducting tissue that partially or totallybypass normal AV connections (bypass tracts). They run most commonly from the atria directly to theventricles and less commonly from the atrium to a portion of the conduction system or from a portion ofthe conduction system to the ventricle. They can be triggered by atrial premature beats or ventricularpremature beats.\\nWolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome: WPW (preexcitation) syndrome is the most commonaccessory pathway SVT, occurring in about 1 to 3/1000 people. WPW syndrome is mainly idiopathic,although it is more common among patients with hypertrophic or other forms of cardiomyopathy,transposition of the great vessels, or Epstein's anomaly.\\nIn classic (or manifest) WPW syndrome, antegrade conduction occurs over both the accessory pathwayand the normal conducting system during sinus rhythm. The accessory pathway, being faster, depolarizessome of the ventricle early, resulting in a short PR interval and a slurred upstroke to the QRS complex(delta wave—seeFig. 213-12).\\nThe delta wave prolongs QRS duration to > 0.1 sec, although the overall configuration, apart from thedelta wave, may appear normal. Depending on the orientation of the delta wave, a pseudoinfarctionpattern Q-wave may be present. Because the early depolarized parts of the ventricle also repolarize early,the T-wave vector may be abnormal.\\nIn concealed WPW syndrome, the accessory pathway does not conduct in an antegrade direction;consequently, the above ECG abnormalities do not appear. However, it conducts in a retrograde directionand thus can participate in reentrant tachycardia.\\nIn the most common form of reentrant tachycardia (called orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia), thecircuit uses the normal AV conduction pathway to activate the ventricles, returning to the atrium via theaccessory AV connection. The resultant QRS complex is thus narrow (unless bundle branch block\\n[Fig. 213-12. Classic Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.]\\ncoexists) and without a delta wave. Orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia is typically a short RPtachycardia with the retrograde P wave in the ST segment.\\nRarely, the reentrant circuit revolves in the opposite direction, from the atrium to the ventricle via theaccessory AV connection, and returns from the ventricle in the retrograde direction up the normal AVconduction system (called antidromic reciprocating tachycardia). The QRS complex is wide because theventricles are activated abnormally. In patients with 2 accessory AV connections (not uncommon), areciprocating tachycardia using one accessory connection in the antegrade direction and the other in theretrograde direction may occur.\\nTachycardias in WPW syndrome may begin as or degenerate into atrial fibrillation (AF), which can be verydangerous (see p. 2172).

However, if the mechanism of the tachycardia isunknown, ventricular tachycardia has not been excluded, and AV nodal blockers should be avoidedbecause they may worsen ventricular tachycardias. In such cases (or those in which drugs areineffective), IV procainamide or amiodarone can be used. Alternatively, synchronized cardioversion with50 joules (0.5 to 2 joules/kg for children) is quick and safe and may be preferred to these more toxicdrugs.\\nWhen episodes of AV nodal reentrant tachycardia are frequent or bothersome, options include long-termantiarrhythmics or transvenous catheter radiofrequency ablation. Generally, ablation is recommended, butif it is not acceptable, drug prophylaxis usually begins with digoxin and proceeds, as required, to β-blockers, nondihydropyridine Ca channel blockers, or both, then to one or more class Ia, class Ic, or classIII antiarrhythmics.\\nAtrial Fibrillation and Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome\\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a medical emergency in the setting of antegrade conduction over anaccessory pathway in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.\\nIn manifest WPW syndrome, antegrade conduction occurs over the accessory pathway. If AF develops,the normal rate-limiting effects of the atrioventricular (AV) node are bypassed, and the resultant excessiveventricular rates (sometimes 200 to 240 beats/min) may lead to ventricular fibrillation (seeFig. 213-14) and sudden death. Patients with concealed WPW syndrome are not at risk because in them,antegrade conduction does not occur over the accessory connection.\\n[Fig. 213-14. Atrial fibrillation in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.]\\nThe treatment of choice is direct-current cardioversion. The usual rate-slowing drugs used in AF are noteffective, and digoxin and the nondihydropyridine Ca channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) arecontraindicated because they may increase the ventricular rate and cause ventricular fibrillation. Ifcardioversion is impossible, drugs that prolong the refractory period of the accessory connection shouldbe used. IV procainamide or amiodarone is preferred, but any class Ia, class Ic, or class III antiarrhythmiccan be used.\\nBundle Branch and Fascicular Block\\nBundle branch block is partial or complete interruption of impulse conduction in a bundlebranch; fascicular block is similar interruption in a hemifascicle of the bundle. The 2 disordersoften coexist. There are usually no symptoms, but presence of either suggests a heart disorder.Diagnosis is by ECG. No specific treatment is indicated.\\nConduction blocks can be caused by many heart disorders, including intrinsic degeneration withoutanother associated heart disorder.\\nRight bundle branch block (RBBB—seeFig. 213-15) can occur in apparently normal people. It may also occur with anterior MI, indicatingsubstantial myocardial injury. New appearance of RBBB should prompt a search for underlying cardiacpathology, but often, none is found. Transient RBBB may occur after pulmonary embolism. AlthoughRBBB distorts the QRS complex, it does not significantly interfere with ECG diagnosis of MI.\\nLeft bundle branch block (LBBB—seeFig. 213-16) is associated with a structural heart disorder more often than is RBBB. LBBB usuallyprecludes use of ECG for diagnosis of MI.\\nFascicular block involves the anterior or posterior fascicle of the left bundle branch. Interruption of the leftanterior fascicle causes left anterior hemiblock characterized by modest QRS prolongation (< 120 msec)and a frontal plane QRS axis more negative than -30° (left axis deviation). Left posterior hemiblock isassociated with a frontal plane QRS axis more positive than +120°. The associations between hemiblocks\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 213.

Trifascicular block refers to RBBB with alternating left anterior and left posterior hemiblock oralternating LBBB and RBBB. Presence of bifascicular or trifascicular block after MI implies extensivecardiac damage. Bifascicular blocks require no direct treatment unless intermittent 2nd- or 3rd-degree AVblock is present. True trifascicular blocks require immediate, then permanent pacing.\\nNonspecific intraventricular conduction defects are diagnosed when the QRS complex is\\n[Fig. 213-15.

The conduction delay mayoccur beyond the Purkinje fibers and result from slow cell-to-cell myocyte conduction. No specifictreatment is indicated.\\nVentricular Premature Beats\\nVentricular premature beats (VPBs) are single ventricular impulses caused by reentry within theventricle or abnormal automaticity of ventricular cells. They are extremely common in healthypatients and in patients with a heart disorder. VPBs may be asymptomatic or cause palpitations.Diagnosis is by ECG. Treatment is usually not required.\\nVPBs, also called premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), may occur erratically or at predictableintervals (eg, every 3rd [trigeminy] or 2nd [bigeminy] beat). VPBs may increase with stimulants (eg,anxiety, stress, alcohol, caffeine, sympathomimetic drugs), hypoxia, or electrolyte abnormalities.\\nVPBs may be experienced as missed or skipped beats; the VPB itself is not sensed but rather thefollowing augmented sinus beat. When VPBs are very frequent, particularly when they represent every2nd heart beat, mild hemodynamic symptoms are possible because the sinus rate has been effectivelyhalved. Existing ejection murmurs may be accentuated because of increased cardiac filling andaugmented contractility after the compensatory pause.\\nDiagnosis\\n• ECG\\nDiagnosis is by ECG showing a wide QRS complex without a preceding P wave, typically followed by afully compensatory pause.\\nPrognosis\\nVPBs are not significant in patients without a heart disorder, and no treatment is required beyond avoidingobvious triggers. β-Blockers are offered only if symptoms are intolerable. Other antiarrhythmics thatsuppress VPBs increase risk of more serious arrhythmias.\\nTreatment\\n• β-Blockers for patients with symptomatic heart failure and after MI\\nIn patients with a structural heart disorder (eg, aortic stenosis, post MI), treatment is controversial eventhough frequent VPBs (> 10/h) correlate with increased mortality, because no studies have shown thatpharmacologic suppression reduces mortality. In post-MI patients, mortality rate is higher with class Iantiarrhythmics than with placebo.

Diagnosis is by ECG. Treatment of more than brief episodes is with cardioversion orantiarrhythmics depending on symptoms. If necessary, long-term treatment is with animplantable cardioverter defibrillator.\\nSome experts use a cutoff rate of ≥ 100 beats/min for VT. Repetitive ventricular rhythms at slower ratesare called accelerated idioventricular rhythms or slow VT; they are usually benign and are not treatedunless associated with hemodynamic symptoms.\\nMost patients with VT have a significant heart disorder, particularly prior MI or a cardiomyopathy.Electrolyte abnormalities (particularly hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), acidemia, hypoxemia, andadverse drug effects contribute. The long QT syndrome (congenital or acquired) is associated with aparticular form of VT, torsades de pointes.\\nVT may be monomorphic or polymorphic and nonsustained or sustained. Monomorphic VT results from asingle abnormal focus or reentrant pathway and has regular, identical-appearing QRS complexes.Polymorphic VT results from several different foci or pathways and is thus irregular, with varying QRScomplexes. Nonsustained VT lasts < 30 sec; sustained VT lasts ≥ 30 sec or is terminated sooner becauseof hemodynamic collapse. VT frequently deteriorates to ventricular fibrillation and thus cardiac arrest (seep. 2255).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nVT of short duration or slow rate may be asymptomatic. Sustained VT is almost always symptomatic,causing palpitations, symptoms of hemodynamic compromise, or sudden cardiac death.\\nDiagnosis\\n• ECG\\nDiagnosis is by ECG (seeFig. 213-17). Any wide QRS complex tachycardia (QRS ≥ 0.12 sec) should be considered VT until provedotherwise. Diagnosis is supported by ECG findings of dissociated P-wave activity, fusion or capturebeats, uniformity of QRS vectors in the V leads (concordance) with discordant T-wave vector (oppositeQRS vectors), and a frontal-plane QRS axis in the northwest quadrant. Differential diagnosis includessupraventricular tachycardia conducted with bundle branch block or via an accessory pathway (see Table213-1). However, because some patients tolerate VT surprisingly well, concluding that a well-toleratedwide\\n[Fig. 213-17.

Hypotensive VT requires synchronizeddirect-current cardioversion with ≥ 100 joules. Stable sustained VT can be treated with IV drugs, usuallylidocaine (see Table 213-2), which acts quickly but is frequently ineffective. If lidocaine is ineffective, IVprocainamide may be given, but it may take up to 1 h to work. Failure of IV procainamide is an indicationfor cardioversion.\\nNonsustained VT does not require immediate treatment unless the runs are frequent or long enough tocause symptoms. In such cases, antiarrhythmics are used as for sustained VT.\\nLong-term: The primary goal is preventing sudden death, rather than simply suppressing the arrhythmia.It is best accomplished by use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD—see p. 2159). However,the decision about whom to treat is complex and depends on the estimated probability of life-threateningVTs and the severity of underlying heart disorders (see Table 213-5).\\nLong-term treatment is not required when the index episode of VT resulted from a transient cause (eg,during the 48 h after onset of MI) or a reversible cause (acid-base disturbances, electrolyte abnormalities,proarrhythmic drug effect).\\nIn the absence of a transient or reversible cause, patients who have had an episode of sustained VTtypically require an ICD. Most patients with sustained VT and a significant structural heart disorder shouldalso receive a β-blocker. If an ICD cannot be used, amiodarone may be the preferred antiarrhythmic forprevention of sudden death.\\nBecause nonsustained VT is a marker for increased risk of sudden death in patients with a structuralheart disorder, such patients (particularly those with an ejection fraction < 0.35) require further evaluation.Such patients should receive an ICD.\\nWhen prevention of VTs is important (usually in patients who have an ICD and are having frequentepisodes of VT), antiarrhythmics or transcatheter radiofrequency or surgical ablation of thearrhythmogenic substrate is required. Any class Ia, Ib, Ic, II, or III drug can be used. Because β-blockersare safe, they are the first choice unless contraindicated. If an additional drug is required, sotalol iscommonly used, then amiodarone.\\nTranscatheter radiofrequency ablation is used most commonly in patients who have VT with well-definedsyndromes (eg, right ventricular outflow tract VT or left septal VT [Belhassen VT, verapamil-sensitive VT])and otherwise healthy hearts.\\nLong QT Syndrome and Torsades de Pointes Ventricular Tachycardia\\nTorsades de pointes is a specific form of polymorphic VT in patients with a long QT interval. It ischaracterized by rapid, irregular QRS complexes, which appear to be twisting around the ECGbaseline. This arrhythmia may cease spontaneously or degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. Itcauses significant hemodynamic compromise and often death. Diagnosis is by ECG. Treatmentis with IV Mg, measures to shorten the QT interval, and often direct-current cardioversion.\\nThe long QT interval responsible for torsades de pointes can be congenital or drug-induced. QT-intervalprolongation predisposes to arrhythmia by prolonging repolarization, which induces early after-depolarizations and spatial dispersion of refractoriness.\\nCongenital: At least 10 distinct forms of congenital long QT syndrome have been described. Most casesfall into the first 3 subgroups:\\n• Long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1), caused by a loss of function mutation of gene KCNQ1, whichencodes an adrenergic-sensitive cardiac K current IKs\\n• Long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2), caused by a loss of function mutation of gene HERG, whichencodes another cardiac K channel (IKr)\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 213.

Other drugs that can induce torsades de pointes include tricyclic antidepressants,phenothiazines, and certain antivirals and antifungals (see www.torsades.org for an up-to-date list).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nPatients often present with syncope because the underlying rate (200 to 250 beats/min) is nonperfusing.Palpitations are common among conscious patients. Sometimes the long QT interval is detected afterresuscitation.\\nDiagnosis\\n• ECG\\nDiagnosis is by ECG showing an undulating QRS axis, with the polarity of complexes shifting around thebaseline (see Fig. 213-18). ECG between episodes shows a long QT interval after correction for heartrate (QTc). Normal values average about 0.44 sec, although they vary among individuals and by sex. Afamily history may suggest a congenital syndrome.\\nTreatment\\n• Usually unsynchronized direct-current cardioversion\\n• Sometimes magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) IV\\nAn acute episode prolonged enough to cause hemodynamic compromise is treated with unsynchronizedcardioversion, beginning with 100 joules. Nevertheless, early recurrence is the rule. Patients oftenrespond to Mg: MgSO4 2 g IV over 1 to 2 min. If this treatment is unsuccessful, a 2nd bolus is given in 5to 10 min, and an Mg infusion of 3 to 20 mg/min may be started in patients without renal insufficiency.Lidocaine (class Ib) shortens the QT interval and may be effective especially for drug-induced torsadesde pointes. Class Ia, Ic, and III antiarrhythmics are avoided.\\nIf a drug is the cause, it is stopped, but until drug clearance is complete, patients with frequent or longruns of torsades de pointes require treatment to shorten the QT interval. Because increasing the heartrate shortens the QT interval, temporary pacing, IV isoproterenol, or both are often effective. Long-termtreatment is required for patients with a congenital long QT-interval syndrome. Treatment choices includeβ-blockers, permanent pacing, ICD, or a combination. Family members should be evaluated by ECG.\\nPatients with congenital long QT syndrome should clearly avoid drugs that prolong the QT interval, andpatients with exercise-related symptoms (usually LQT1 or LQT2) should avoid strenuous exercise.Treatment options include β-blockers, pacing to maintain faster heart rates (which shortens the QTinterval), and the ICD, alone or in combinations. Current guidelines recommend the ICD for patientsresuscitated from cardiac arrest and those with syncope despite β-blocker treatment.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 213.

The ST segment is coved and descends to aninverted T-wave. Lesser degrees of these patterns (type 2 and type 3 Brugada ECG patterns) are notconsidered diagnostic. The type 2 and type 3 patterns may change to a type 1 pattern spontaneously,with fever, or in response to drugs.

Valvular Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nAny heart valve can become stenotic or insufficient, causing hemodynamic changes long beforesymptoms. Most often, valvular stenosis or insufficiency occurs in isolation in individual valves, butmultiple valvular disorders may coexist and a single valve may be both stenosed and insufficient.\\nTreatment depends on severity of disease but usually involves catheter-based valvuloplasty (eg,percutaneous balloon commissurotomy, valvotomy) or surgery (eg, surgical commissurotomy, valve repair,valve replacement). Two kinds of valve prosthesis are used: bioprosthetic (porcine) and mechanical(manufactured).\\nTraditionally, a mechanical valve has been used in patients < 65 and in older patients with a long lifeexpectancy, because bioprosthetic valves deteriorate over 10 to 12 yr. Patients with a mechanical valve orbioprosthetic mitral valve require lifelong anticoagulation to an INR of 2.5 to 3.5 (to preventthromboembolism) and antibiotics before some medical or dental procedures (to prevent endocarditis). Anaortic bioprosthetic valve, which does not require anticoagulation beyond the immediate postoperativeperiod, has been used in patients > 65, younger patients with a life expectancy < 10 yr, and those withsome right-sided lesions. However, newer bioprosthetic valves may be more durable than 1st-generationvalves; thus, patient preference regarding valve type can now be considered.\\nWomen of childbearing age who require valve replacement and plan to become pregnant must balancethe increased risk of teratogenicity from warfarin with mechanical valves against that of accelerated valvedeterioration with bioprosthetic valves. These risks can be reduced by use of heparin instead of warfarinin the first 12 wk and last 2 wk of the pregnancy, but management is difficult and careful discussion isrequired before surgery.\\nEndocarditis prophylaxis is rarely indicated for patients with valvular heart disorders (see p.2199).\\nAortic Regurgitation\\nAortic regurgitation (AR) is incompetency of the aortic valve causing flow from the aorta into theleft ventricle during diastole. Causes include idiopathic valvular degeneration, rheumatic fever,endocarditis, myxomatous degeneration, congenital bicuspid aortic valve, aortic root dilatationor dissection, and connective tissue or rheumatologic disorders. Symptoms include exertionaldyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, and chest pain. Signs includewidened pulse pressure and an early diastolic murmur. Diagnosis is by physical examinationand echocardiography. Surgical treatment is aortic valve replacement.\\nEtiology\\nAR may be acute or chronic. The primary causes of acute AR are infective endocarditis and dissection ofthe ascending aorta. Mild chronic AR in adults is most often caused by a bicuspid or fenestrated aorticvalve (2% of men and 1% of women), especially when severe diastolic hypertension (pressure ≥ 110 mmHg) is present. Moderate to severe chronic AR in adults is most often caused by idiopathic degenerationof the aortic valves or root, rheumatic fever, infective endocarditis, myxomatous degeneration, or trauma.In children, the most common cause is a ventricular septal defect with aortic valve prolapse. Rarely, AR iscaused by seronegative spondyloarthropathies (ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriaticarthritis), RA, SLE, arthritis associated with ulcerative colitis, luetic (syphilitic) aortitis, osteogenesisimperfecta, thoracic aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, supravalvular aortic stenosis, Takayasu's arteritis,rupture of a sinus of Valsalva, acromegaly, and temporal (giant cell) arteritis.

These changes may ultimately cause arrhythmias, LV impairment, and heart failure (HF).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAcute AR causes symptoms of HF and cardiogenic shock. Chronic AR is typically asymptomatic for years;progressive exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and palpitations developinsidiously. Symptoms of HF correlate poorly with objective measures of LV function. Chest pain (anginapectoris) affects only about 5% of patients who do not have coexisting coronary artery disease (CAD)and, when it occurs, is especially common at night. Patients may present with endocarditis (eg, fever,anemia, weight loss, embolic phenomena) because the abnormal aortic valve is predisposed to bacterialseeding.\\nSigns vary by severity. As chronic disease progresses, systolic BP increases while diastolic BPdecreases, creating a widened pulse pressure. With time, the LV impulse may become enlarged,sustained, increased in amplitude, and displaced downward and laterally, with systolic depression of theentire left parasternal area, giving a rocking motion to the left chest.\\nA systolic apical or carotid thrill may become palpable in later stages of AR; it is caused by large forwardstroke volumes and low aortic diastolic pressure.\\nAuscultatory findings include a normal 1st heart sound (S1) and a nonsplit, loud, sharp or slapping 2ndheart sound (S2) caused by increased elastic aortic recoil. The murmur of AR is often unimpressive. Themurmur is blowing, high-pitched, diastolic, and decrescendo, beginning soon after the aortic componentof S2 (A2); it is loudest at the 3rd or 4th left parasternal intercostal space. The murmur is heard best withthe diaphragm of the stethoscope when the patient is leaning forward, with breath held at end-expiration.It increases in volume in response to maneuvers that increase afterload (eg, squatting, isometrichandgrip). If AR is slight, the murmur may occur only in early diastole. If LV diastolic pressure is very high,the murmur is short because aortic and LV diastolic pressures equalize earlier in diastole.\\nOther abnormal sounds include a forward ejection and backward regurgitant flow (to-and-fro) murmur, anejection click soon after the S1, and an aortic ejection flow murmur. A diastolic murmur heard near theaxilla or mid left thorax (Cole-Cecil murmur) is caused by fusion of the aortic murmur with the 3rd heartsound (S3), which is due to simultaneous filling of LV from the left atrium and AR. A mid-to-late diastolicrumble heard at the apex (Austin Flint murmur) may result from rapid regurgitant flow into the LV, causingmitral valve leaflet vibration at the peak of atrial flow; this murmur mimics the diastolic murmur of mitralstenosis.\\nOther signs are unusual; sensitivity and specificity are low or unknown. Visible signs include headbobbing (Musset's sign) and pulsation of the fingernail capillaries (Quincke's sign, best seen with slightpressure) or uvula (Muller's sign). Palpable signs include a large-volume pulse with rapid rise and fall(slapping, water-hammer, or collapsing pulse) and pulsation of the carotid arteries (Corrigan's sign),retinal arteries (Becker's sign), liver (Rosenbach's sign), or spleen (Gerhard's sign). BP findings mayinclude popliteal systolic pressure ≥ 60 mm Hg higher than brachial pressure (Hill's sign) and a fall indiastolic BP of > 15 mm Hg with arm elevation (Mayne's sign). Auscultatory signs include a sharp soundheard over the femoral pulse (pistol-shot sound, or Traube's sign) and a femoral systolic bruit distal and adiastolic bruit proximal to arterial compression (Duroziez's murmur).\\nDiagnosis\\n• Echocardiography\\nDiagnosis is suspected based on history and physical examination and confirmed by echocardiography.Doppler echocardiography is the test of choice to detect and quantify the magnitude of regurgitant bloodflow.

ECG may show repolarization abnormalities with or withoutQRS voltage criteria of LV hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement, and T-wave inversion with ST-segmentdepression in precordial leads. Chest x-ray may show cardiomegaly and a prominent aortic root inpatients with chronic progressive AR. If AR is severe, signs of pulmonary edema and HF may also bepresent. Exercise testing may help assess functional capacity and symptoms in patients with documentedAR and equivocal symptoms.\\nCoronary angiography should be done before surgery, even if no angina is present, because about 20%of patients with severe AR have significant CAD, which may need concomitant coronary artery bypassgraft surgery.\\nPrognosis\\nWith treatment, the 10-yr survival for patients with mild to moderate AR is 80 to 95%. With appropriatelytimed valve replacement (ie, before HF and using criteria below), long-term prognosis for patients withmoderate to severe AR is good. However, the prognosis for those with severe AR and HF is considerablypoorer.\\nTreatment\\n• Aortic valve replacement\\n• Sometimes vasodilators, diuretics, and nitrates\\nTreatment of acute AR is aortic valve replacement. Treatment of chronic AR varies by symptoms anddegree of LV dysfunction. Patients with symptoms precipitated by normal daily activity or during exercisetesting require aortic valve replacement; patients who prefer to avoid surgery may be treated withvasodilators (eg, long-acting nifedipine 30 to 90 mg po once/day or ACE inhibitors). Also, diuretics ornitrates to reduce preload may be beneficial for severe AR. Asymptomatic patients with LVEF < 55%, anend-systolic diameter ≥ 55 mm (55 rule), or an end-diastolic diameter > 75 mm also require surgery; oraldrugs are a 2nd-best option for this group. Additional surgical criteria have been proposed, includingfractional shortening < 25 to 29%, end-diastolic radius to myocardial wall thickness ratio > 4.0, andcardiac index < 2.2 to 2.5 L/min/m2.\\nPatients who do not meet these criteria should be reevaluated by physical examination,echocardiography, and possibly rest-exercise radionuclide cineangiography to measure LV contractilityevery 6 to 12 mo.\\nAntibiotic prophylaxis against endocarditis is no longer recommended except for patients who have hadvalve replacement (seeTable 215-4).\\nAortic Stenosis\\nAortic stenosis (AS) is narrowing of the aortic valve obstructing blood flow from the leftventricle to the ascending aorta during systole. Causes include a congenital bicuspid valve,idiopathic degenerative sclerosis with calcification, and rheumatic fever. Progressive untreatedAS ultimately results in one or more of the classic triad of syncope, angina, and exertionaldyspnea; heart failure and arrhythmias may develop.

For progressive severe or symptomatic AS in children, balloon valvotomy is used;adults require valve replacement.\\nEtiology\\nAortic sclerosis, a degenerative aortic valve disease with thickening of aortic valve structures by fibrosisand calcification initially without causing significant obstruction, is the most common cause of AS inelderly patients. Over years, aortic sclerosis progresses to stenosis in as many as 15% of patients. Aorticsclerosis resembles atherosclerosis, with deposition of lipoproteins, active inflammation, and calcificationof the valves; risk factors are similar (see p. 2082).\\nThe most common cause of AS in patients < 70 yr is a congenital bicuspid aortic valve. Congenital ASoccurs in 3 to 5/1000 live births and affects more males.\\nIn developing countries, rheumatic fever is the most common cause in all age groups. Supravalvular AScaused by a discrete, congenital membrane or hypoplastic constriction just above the sinuses of Valsalvais uncommon. A sporadic form of supravalvular AS is associated with a characteristic facies (high andbroad forehead, hypertelorism, strabismus, upturned nose, long philtrum, wide mouth, dentalabnormalities, puffy cheeks, micrognathia, low-set ears). When associated with idiopathic hypercalcemiaof infancy, this form is known as Williams syndrome. Subvalvular AS caused by a congenital membrane orfibrous ring just beneath the aortic valve is uncommon.\\nPathophysiology\\nAortic regurgitation may accompany AS, and about 60% of patients > 60 yr with significant AS also havemitral annular calcification, which may lead to significant mitral regurgitation.\\nThe left ventricle (LV) gradually hypertrophies in response to AS. Significant LV hypertrophy causesdiastolic dysfunction and, with progression, may lead to decreased contractility, ischemia, or fibrosis, anyof which may cause systolic dysfunction and heart failure (HF). LV chamber enlargement is a late findingunless there is coexisting MI. Patients with AS have a higher incidence of GI bleeding (called Heyde'ssyndrome) because the high shear stress of stenotic valves makes multimeric von Willebrand's factormore susceptible to cleavage by a plasma metalloprotease and may increase platelet clearance. GIbleeding may also be due to angiodysplasia.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nCongenital AS is usually asymptomatic until at least age 10 or 20 yr, when symptoms may begin todevelop insidiously. In all forms, progressive untreated AS ultimately results in exertional syncope, angina,and dyspnea (SAD triad). Other symptoms and signs may include those of HF and arrhythmias, includingventricular fibrillation leading to sudden death.\\nExertional syncope occurs because cardiac output cannot increase enough to meet the demands ofphysical activity. Nonexertional syncope may result from altered baroreceptor responses or ventriculartachycardia. Exertional angina pectoris affects about two thirds of patients; about one half havesignificant coronary artery atherosclerosis, and one half have normal coronary arteries but have ischemiainduced by LV hypertrophy, altered coronary flow dynamics, or both.\\nThere are no visible signs of AS. Palpable signs include carotid and peripheral pulses that are reduced inamplitude and slow rising (pulsus parvus, mollus et tardus) and an apical impulse that is sustained(thrusts with the 1st heart sound [S1] and relaxes with the 2nd heart sound [S2]) because of LVhypertrophy. The LV impulse may become displaced when systolic dysfunction develops. A palpable 4thheart sound (S4), felt best at the apex, and a systolic thrill, corresponding with the murmur of AS and feltbest at the left upper sternal border, are occasionally present in severe cases. Systolic BP may be highwith mild or moderate AS and falls as AS becomes more severe.\\nOn auscultation, S1 is normal and S2 is single because aortic valve closing is delayed and merges with\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 214.

The aortic component may also be soft. Paradoxical splitting of S2may be heard. An S4 may be audible. An ejection click may also be audible early after S1 in patients withcongenital bicuspid AS when valve leaflets are stiff but not completely immobile. The click does notchange with dynamic maneuvers.\\nThe hallmark finding is a crescendodecrescendo ejection murmur, heard best with the diaphragm of thestethoscope at the right and left upper sternal border when a patient who is sitting upright leans forward.The murmur typically radiates to the right clavicle and both carotid arteries (left often louder than right)and has a harsh or grating quality. But in elderly patients, vibration of the un-fused cusps of calcifiedaortic valve leaflets may transmit a louder, more high-pitched, \"cooing\" or musical sound to the cardiacapex, with softening or absence of the murmur parasternally (Gallavardin\\'s phenomenon), therebymimicking mitral regurgitation. The murmur is soft when stenosis is less severe, grows louder as stenosisprogresses, and becomes longer and peaks in volume later in systole (ie, crescendo phase becomeslonger and decrescendo phase becomes shorter) as stenosis becomes more severe. As LV contractilitydecreases in critical AS, the murmur becomes softer and shorter. The intensity of the murmur maytherefore be misleading in these circumstances.\\nThe murmur of AS typically increases with maneuvers that increase LV volume and contractility (eg, leg-raising, squatting, Valsalva release, after a ventricular premature beat) and decreases with maneuversthat decrease LV volume (Valsalva maneuver) or increase afterload (isometric handgrip). These dynamicmaneuvers have the opposite effect on the murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which can otherwiseresemble that of AS. The murmur of mitral regurgitation due to prolapse of the posterior leaflet may alsomimic AS.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Echocardiography\\nDiagnosis is suspected clinically and confirmed by echocardiography. Two-dimensional transthoracicechocardiography is used to identify a stenotic aortic valve and possible causes, to quantify LVhypertrophy and degree of diastolic or systolic dysfunction, and to detect coexisting valvular heartdisorders (aortic regurgitation, mitral valve disorders) and complications (eg, endocarditis). Dopplerechocardiography is used to quantify degree of stenosis by measuring aortic valve area, jet velocity, andtransvalvular systolic pressure gradient.\\nA valve area of 0.5 to 1.0 cm2 or a mean gradient > 45 to 50 mm Hg represents severe stenosis. Thegradient may be overestimated in aortic regurgitation and underestimated in LV systolic dysfunction. Therate of progression of AS from mild to severe is quite variable and does not necessarily proceed in alinear fashion.\\nCardiac catheterization is necessary to determine whether coronary artery disease (CAD) is the cause ofangina and, occasionally, to resolve differences between clinical and echocardiographic findings.\\nAn ECG and chest x-ray are obtained. ECG typically shows changes of LV hypertrophy with or without anischemic ST- and T-wave pattern. Chest x-ray findings may include calcification of the aortic cusps (seenon the lateral projection or on fluoroscopy) and evidence of HF. Heart size may be normal or only mildlyenlarged.\\nPrognosis\\nAS may progress slowly or quickly and thus requires regular follow-up to detect progression, particularlyin sedentary elderly patients. In such patients, flow may become significantly compromised withouttriggering symptoms.\\nOverall, about 3 to 6% of asymptomatic patients with normal systolic function develop symptoms or LVejection fraction depression every year.

Mean survival in untreated symptomatic patients is about 2 to 3 yr.Aortic valve replacement relieves symptoms and improves survival. Risk with surgery increases forpatients who require simultaneous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and for those with depressedsystolic LV function.\\nAbout 50% of deaths occur suddenly. While awaiting surgery, patients with severe AS should be advisedto restrict physical exertion.\\nTreatment\\n• Sometimes aortic valve replacement\\nAsymptomatic patients with a maximum gradient ≤ 25 mm Hg and a valve area > 1.0 cm2have a lowmortality and low overall risk of requiring surgery in the next 2 yr; annual evaluation for symptomprogression, including echocardiography to determine gradient and valve area, is appropriate.\\nAsymptomatic patients with gradients of 25 to 50 mm Hg or valve area < 1.0 cm2 are at higher risk ofdeveloping symptoms in the next 2 yr, but generally elective valve replacement is not required in theabsence of symptoms. Valve replacement is indicated for patients who have moderate or severe AS andprimarily require CABG. Surgery may be indicated for patients who become hypotensive during exercisetreadmill testing and for those with LV ejection fraction < 50%. Patients with ventricular arrhythmias andsevere LV hypertrophy are also often referred for surgery, but benefits are less clear. Recommendationsfor patients without any of these qualifying conditions include more frequent monitoring for progression ofsymptoms, LV hypertrophy, gradients, and valve area with medical management as needed. It is unclearwhether statins reduce the progression of AS. Other drugs may be detrimental, especially those that cancause hypotension. Small studies suggest that perhexilene maleate may decrease symptoms.Nitroprusside has been used as a temporizing measure to reduce afterload in patients withdecompensated HF in the hours before valve replacement, but because this drug can have the sameeffect as rapid-acting nitrates, it must be used cautiously and monitoring is required.\\nSymptomatic patients should undergo valve replacement or balloon valvotomy. Valve replacement isindicated for virtually all who can tolerate surgery. In younger patients, the patient's own pulmonic valvecan be used, providing good durability; a bioprosthesis is then used to replace the pulmonic valve (Rossprocedure). Most often, the aortic valve is replaced with a mechanical or bio-prosthetic valve.Preoperative evaluation for CAD is indicated so that CABG and valve replacement, if indicated, can bedone during the same procedure.\\nBalloon valvotomy is used primarily in children and very young adults with congenital AS. In older patientswho are unfit for surgery, balloon valvuloplasty can provide temporary relief of symptoms, perhaps for 6 to12 mo, and can be repeated in selected patients. Minimally invasive percutaneous valve replacement isbeing used as an alternative procedure in very elderly or frail patients.\\nMitral Valve Prolapse\\nMitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a billowing of mitral valve leaflets into the left atrium duringsystole. The most common cause is idiopathic myxomatous degeneration. MVP is usuallybenign, but complications include mitral regurgitation, endocarditis, valve rupture, and possiblythromboembolism. MVP is usually asymptomatic in the absence of important regurgitation,although there are reports that some patients experience chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, andpalpitations. Signs include a crisp mid-systolic click, followed by a late systolic murmur ifregurgitation is present. Diagnosis is by physical examination and echocardiography. Prognosisis excellent in the absence of significant regurgitation, but chordal rupture and endocarditis mayoccur. No specific treatment is necessary unless mitral regurgitation is present.\\nMVP is common; prevalence is 1 to 3% in otherwise normal populations, depending on theechocardiographic criteria used.

Myxomatous degeneration may also be caused by connective tissue disorders(eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, adult polycystic kidney disease, osteogenesisimperfecta, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, SLE, polyarteritis nodosa) and muscular dystrophies. MVP ismore common among patients with Graves' disease, hypomastia, von Willebrand's syndrome, sickle celldisease, and rheumatic heart disease. Myxomatous degeneration may also affect the aortic or tricuspidvalve, resulting in aortic or tricuspid prolapse. Tricuspid regurgitation is uncommon.\\nMitral regurgitation (MR) may occur in patients with apparently normal mitral valve leaflets (ie,nonmyxomatous) if papillary muscle dysfunction is present or the mitral annulus is dilated (eg, in dilatedcardiomyopathy). In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with outflow obstruction, MR occurs due to interferencewith the closure of the mitral leaflets (which may also be abnormal). Transient MVP may occur whenintravascular volume decreases significantly, as occurs in severe dehydration or sometimes duringpregnancy (when the woman is recumbent and the gravid uterus compresses the inferior vena cava,reducing venous return).\\nMR is the most common complication of MVP. MR may be acute (due to ruptured chordae tendineae orflail mitral valve leaflets) or chronic; sequelae of chronic MR include heart failure and atrial fibrillation (AF)with thromboembolism. Whether MVP causes stroke independent of MR and AF is unclear. In addition,MR increases the risk of infective endocarditis.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMost patients are asymptomatic. Some experience nonspecific symptoms (eg, chest pain, dyspnea,palpitations, dizziness, near syncope, migraines, anxiety), thought to be due to poorly defined associatedabnormalities in adrenergic signaling and sensitivity rather than to mitral valve pathology. In about onethird of patients, emotional stress precipitates palpitations, which may be a symptom of benignarrhythmias (atrial premature beats, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, ventricular premature beats, complexventricular ectopy).\\nOccasionally, patients present with MR. Rarely, patients present with endocarditis (eg, fever, weight loss,thromboembolic phenomena) or stroke. Sudden death occurs in < 1%, most often resulting from rupturedchordae tendineae and flail mitral valve leaflets. Death due to a fatal arrhythmia is rare.\\nTypically, MVP causes no visible or palpable cardiac signs. MVP alone causes a crisp mid-systolic clickheard best with the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the left apex when the patient is in the left lateraldecubitus position. MVP with MR causes a click with a late-systolic MR murmur. The click becomesaudible or moves closer to the 1st heart sound (S1) and becomes louder with maneuvers that decreaseleft ventricle (LV) size (eg, sitting, standing, Valsalva maneuver); the same maneuvers cause an MRmurmur to appear or become louder and last longer. These effects occur because decreasing LV sizecauses papillary muscles and chordae tendineae to pull together more centrally beneath the valve,resulting in quicker, more forceful prolapse with earlier, more severe regurgitation. Conversely, squattingor isometric handgrip delays the S1 click and shortens the MR murmur. The systolic click may beconfused with the click of congenital aortic stenosis, which can be distinguished because it occurs veryearly in systole and does not move with postural or LV volume changes. Other findings include a systolichonk or whoop, thought to be caused by valvular leaflet vibration; these findings are usually transient andmay vary with respiratory phase. An early diastolic opening snap caused by return of the prolapsed valveto its normal position is rarely heard.\\nOther physical findings associated with but not diagnostic of MVP include hypomastia, pectus excavatum,straight back syndrome, and a narrow anteroposterior chest diameter.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 214.

Holosystolicdisplacement of ≥ 3 mm or late systolic displacement of ≥ 2 mm identifies 95% of patients with MVP; thepercentage is slightly higher if echocardiography is done while the patient is standing. Thickened,redundant mitral valve leaflets and displacement of ≥ 5 mm are thought to indicate more extensivemyxomatous degeneration and greater risk of endocarditis and MR.\\nHolter monitoring and 12-lead ECG may be useful for documenting arrhythmias in patients withpalpitations.\\nPrognosis\\nMVP is usually benign, but severe myxomatous degeneration of the valve can lead to MR.

A typical regimen is atenolol 25 to 50 mg po once/day or propranolol 20 to40 mg po bid. AF may require additional treatment (see p. 2166).\\nTreatment of MR depends on severity and associated left atrial and LV changes.\\nAntibiotic prophylaxis against endocarditis is no longer recommended. Anticoagulants to preventthromboembolism are recommended only for patients with AF or prior transient ischemic attack or stroke.\\nMitral Regurgitation\\nMitral regurgitation (MR) is incompetency of the mitral valve causing flow from the left ventricle(LV) into the left atrium during systole. Common causes include mitral valve prolapse, ischemicpapillary muscle dysfunction, rheumatic fever, and annular dilation secondary to LV systolicdysfunction and dilation. Complications include progressive heart failure, arrhythmias, andendocarditis. Symptoms and signs include palpitations, dyspnea, and a holosystolic apicalmurmur. Diagnosis is by physical examination and echocardiography. Prognosis depends on LVfunction and severity and duration of MR.

Complications of chronic MR include gradual enlargement of the left atrium (LA); LVenlargement and hypertrophy, which initially compensates for regurgitant flow (preserving forward strokevolume) but eventually decompensates (reducing forward stroke volume); atrial fibrillation (AF), whichmay be further complicated by thromboembolism; and infective endocarditis.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAcute MR causes the same symptoms and signs as acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock (see p.2116).

Symptomsinclude dyspnea, fatigue (due to heart failure), orthopnea, and palpitations (often due to AF). Rarely,patients present with endocarditis (eg, fever, weight loss, embolic phenomena).\\nSigns develop only when MR becomes moderate to severe. Inspection and palpation may detect a briskapical impulse and sustained left parasternal movement due to systolic expansion of an enlarged LA. AnLV impulse that is sustained, enlarged, and displaced downward and to the left suggests LV hypertrophyand dilation. A diffuse precordial lift occurs with severe MR because the LA enlarges, causing anteriorcardiac displacement, and pulmonary hypertension causes right ventricular hypertrophy. A regurgitantmurmur (or thrill) may also be palpable in severe cases.\\nOn auscultation, the 1st heart sound (S1) may be soft (or occasionally loud). A 3rd heart sound (S3) atthe apex reflects a dilated LV and important MR.\\nThe cardinal sign of MR is a holosystolic (pansystolic) murmur, heard best at the apex with the diaphragmof the stethoscope when the patient is in the left lateral decubitus position. In mild MR, the systolicmurmur may be abbreviated or occur late in systole. The murmur begins with S1 in conditions causingleaflet incompetency throughout systole, but it often begins after S1 (eg, when chamber dilation duringsystole distorts the valve apparatus or when myocardial ischemia or fibrosis alters dynamics). When themurmur begins after S1, it always continues to the 2nd heart sound (S2). The murmur radiates toward theleft axilla; intensity may remain the same or vary. If intensity varies, the murmur tends to crescendo involume up to S2. MR murmurs increase in intensity with handgrip or squatting because peripheralvascular resistance to ventricular ejection increases, augmenting regurgitation into the LA; murmursdecrease in intensity with standing or the Valsalva maneuver. A short rumbling mid-diastolic inflow murmurdue to torrential mitral diastolic flow may be heard following an S3. In patients with posterior leafletprolapse, the murmur may be coarse and radiate to the upper sternum, mimicking aortic stenosis.\\nMR murmurs may be confused with tricuspid regurgitation, which can be distinguished because itsmurmur is augmented during inspiration.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Echocardiography\\nDiagnosis is suspected clinically and confirmed by echocardiography. Doppler echocardiography is usedto detect regurgitant flow and help quantify its severity; 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional echocardiographyis used to determine the cause of MR and to detect pulmonary hypertension.\\nIf endocarditis or valvular thrombi are suspected, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can provide amore detailed view of the mitral valve and LA. TEE is also indicated when mitral valve repair instead ofreplacement is being considered to confirm the anatomy in more detail.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 214.

ECG may show LA enlargement and LV hypertrophywith or without ischemia. Sinus rhythm is usually present when MR is acute because the atria have nothad time to stretch and remodel.\\nChest x-ray in acute MR may show pulmonary edema; abnormalities in cardiac silhouette are not evidentunless an underlying chronic disorder is also present. Chest x-ray in chronic MR may show LA and LVenlargement. It may also show pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema with heart failure.Cardiac catheterization is done before surgery, mainly to determine whether coronary artery disease(CAD) is present. A prominent systolic c-v wave is seen on pulmonary artery occlusion pressure(pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) tracings during ventricular systole. Ventriculography can be used toquantify MR. Cardiac MRI can accurately measure regurgitant fraction and determine the underlyingcause of dilated myopathy with MR.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis varies by acuity and cause of MR. Once MR becomes severe, about 10% of asymptomaticpatients become symptomatic per year thereafter. About 10% of patients with chronic MR caused by MVPrequire surgical intervention.\\nTreatment\\n• Mitral valve repair or replacement\\nAcute MR requires emergency mitral valve repair or replacement; patients with ischemic papillary musclerupture may also require coronary revascularization. Pending surgery, nitroprusside or nitroglycerininfusion may be used to reduce afterload, thus improving forward stroke volume and reducing ventricularand regurgitant volume.\\nDefinitive treatment of chronic MR is also mitral valve repair or replacement, but patients withasymptomatic or mild chronic MR and no pulmonary hypertension or AF may do well with periodicmonitoring. ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers are used to decrease left ventricular preloadand afterload. They are used in patients with moderate mitral insufficiency to delay dilation of the LV. Loopdiuretics such as furosemide are helpful in patients with exertional or nocturnal dyspnea. Digoxin mayreduce symptoms in patients with AF or those in whom valve surgery is not appropriate. The ideal timingfor surgery is uncertain, but intervention before ventricular decompensation (defined asechocardiographic end-diastolic dimension > 70 mm, end-systolic dimension > 45 mm, and ejectionfraction < 60%) improves outcomes and decreases the chance of worsening LV function. Afterdecompensation, ventricular function becomes dependent on the afterload reduction of MR, and in about50% of decompensated patients, valve replacement causes a markedly depressed ejection fraction. Forpatients with moderate MR and significant CAD, perioperative mortality rate is 1.5% with bypass surgeryalone and 25% with concomitant valve replacement. If technically feasible, valve repair instead ofreplacement is preferred; perioperative mortality rate is 2 to 4% (compared with 5 to 10% forreplacement), and long-term prognosis is good (80 to 94% survival rate at 5 to 10 yr, compared with 40 to60% for replacement).\\nNew percutaneous procedures that tailor the mitral leaflets have been used in elderly and high-riskpatients, and percutaneous placement of artificial valves is under trial.\\nAntibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended except for patients who have had valve replacement(see Table 215-4).\\nAnticoagulants are used to prevent thromboemboli (see p. 1920) in patients with heart failure or AF.Although severe MR without mitral stenosis or AF is less likely to be complicated by atrial thrombosis,most cardiologists still recommend anticoagulants.\\nMitral Stenosis\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 214.

The (almost) invariable cause is rheumatic fever. Commoncomplications are pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and thromboembolism. Symptomsare those of heart failure; signs include an opening snap and a diastolic murmur. Diagnosis is byphysical examination and echocardiography. Prognosis is good. Medical treatment includesdiuretics, β-blockers or rate-limiting Ca channel blockers, and anticoagulants. Effectivetreatment for more severe disease consists of balloon valvotomy, surgical commissurotomy, orvalve replacement.\\nIn MS, mitral valve leaflets become thickened and immobile and the mitral orifice becomes narrowed dueto fusion of the commissures. The chordae are usually thickened, matted, and shortened to a variabledegree, contributing to the reduced mobility of the leaflets. The most common cause is rheumatic fever(see p. 2861), even though many patients do not recall the disorder. Less common causes includebacterial endocarditis, SLE, atrial myxoma, RA, malignant carcinoid syndrome with an atrial right-to-leftshunt, and methysergide. Occasionally, MS is congenital. If the valve cannot close completely, mitralregurgitation (MR) may coexist with MS. Patients with MS due to rheumatic fever may also have lesionsof the aortic or tricuspid valve or both.\\nThe normal area of the mitral valve orifice is 4 to 5 cm2. An area of 1 to 1.5 cm2 reflects moderate MSand often causes exertional symptoms. An area < 1 cm2 represents severe stenosis and may causesymptoms during rest. However, the relationship between the area of the valve orifice and symptoms isnot always reliable. Left atrial (LA) size and pressure increase progressively to compensate for MS;pulmonary venous and capillary pressures also increase and may cause secondary pulmonaryhypertension, leading to right ventricular (RV) heart failure and tricuspid and pulmonic regurgitation. Rateof progression varies.\\nLA enlargement predisposes to atrial fibrillation (AF), a risk factor for thromboembolism. The faster heartrate and loss of atrial contraction with onset of AF often leads to sudden worsening of symptoms.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSymptoms correlate poorly with disease severity because the disease often progresses insidiously andpatients reduce their activity without being aware of it. Many patients are asymptomatic until they becomepregnant or AF develops. Initial symptoms are usually those of heart failure (eg, exertional dyspnea,orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue). They typically do not appear until 15 to 40 yr after anepisode of rheumatic fever, but in developing countries, much younger children may become symptomaticbecause streptococcal infections may not be treated with antibiotics and recurrent infections are common.Paroxysmal or chronic AF exacerbates existing diastolic dysfunction, precipitating pulmonary edema andacute dyspnea when ventricular rate is poorly controlled. AF may also cause palpitations; in up to 15% ofunanticoagulated patients, it causes systemic embolism with symptoms of stroke or other organ ischemia.\\nLess common symptoms include hemoptysis due to rupture of small pulmonary vessels and pulmonaryedema, particularly during pregnancy when blood volume increases; hoarseness due to compression ofthe left recurrent laryngeal nerve by a dilated LA or pulmonary artery (Ortner\\'s syndrome); and symptomsof pulmonary hypertension (see p. 1986) and RV failure (see p. 2120).\\nInspection and palpation may detect palpable 1st and 2nd heart sounds (S1 and S2). S1 is best palpatedat the apex, and S2 at the upper left sternal border. The pulmonic component of S2 (P2) is responsible forthe impulse and results from pulmonary hypertension. An RV impulse (heave) palpable at the left sternalborder may accompany jugular venous distention when pulmonary hypertension is present and RVdiastolic dysfunction develops.\\nAuscultatory findings include a loud S1 caused by the leaflets of a stenotic mitral valve closing abruptly(M1), like a sail on \"coming about\"; it is heard best at the apex. A normally split S2 with an exaggerated P2due to pulmonary hypertension is also heard.

The opening snap may be soft or absent if the mitral valve is calcified; the snapmoves closer to S2 (increasing duration of the murmur) as MS becomes more severe and LA pressureincreases. The diastolic murmur increases after a Valsalva maneuver (when blood pours into the LA),after exercise, and in response to squatting and handgrip. The murmur may be softer or absent when anenlarged RV displaces the LV posteriorly and when other disorders (pulmonary hypertension, right-sidedvalve abnormalities, AF with fast ventricular rate) decrease blood flow across the mitral valve. Thepresystolic crescendo is caused by increased flow with atrial contraction. However, the closing mitralvalve leaflets during LV contraction may also contribute to this finding but only at the end of shortdiastoles when LA pressure is still high.\\nDiastolic murmurs that may coexist with the MS murmur are the early diastolic murmur of coexisting aorticregurgitation (AR), which may be conducted to the apex; the Austin Flint murmur (a low-pitched mid-diastolic murmur heard at the apex due to AR); Graham Steell's murmur (a soft decrescendo diastolicmurmur heard best along the left sternal border and caused by pulmonic regurgitation secondary tosevere pulmonary hypertension); a diastolic flow murmur in the presence of severe MR; and (rarely) anobstructing left atrial myxoma or ball thrombus.\\nMS may cause signs of cor pulmonale (see p. 2132). The classic mitral facies, a plum-colored malarflush, occurs only when cardiac output is low and pulmonary hypertension is severe; cause is cutaneousvasodilation and chronic hypoxemia.\\nOccasionally, the initial symptoms and signs of MS are those of an embolic event such as stroke.Endocarditis is rare in MS unless MR is also present.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Echocardiography\\nDiagnosis is suspected clinically and confirmed by echocardiography. Two-dimensional echocardiographyprovides information about the degree of valvular calcification and stenosis and LA size. Dopplerechocardiography provides information about the transvalvular gradient and pulmonary artery pressure.Transesophageal echocardiography can be used to detect or exclude small LA thrombi, especially thosein the LA appendage, which usually cannot be seen transthoracically.\\nAn ECG and chest x-ray are usually obtained. The ECG may show LA enlargement, manifest as a Pwave lasting > 0.12 msec with prominent negative deflection of its terminal component (duration: > 0.04msec; amplitude: > 0.10 mV) in V1; broad, notched P waves in lead II; or both. Low voltage in V1, rightaxis QRS deviation, and tall R waves in V1 suggest RV hypertrophy.\\nChest x-ray usually shows straightening of the left cardiac border due to a dilated LA appendage, andwidening of the carina. With barium in the esophagus, the lateral chest x-ray will show the dilated LAdisplacing the esophagus posteriorly. The main pulmonary artery (trunk) may be prominent; thedescending right pulmonary artery diameter is ≥ 16 mm if pulmonary hypertension is significant. Theupper lobe pulmonary veins may be dilated. A double shadow of an enlarged LA may be seen along theright cardiac border. Horizontal lines in the lower posterior lung fields (Kerley B lines) indicate interstitialedema associated with high LA pressure.\\nCardiac catheterization, indicated only for perioperative assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD)before surgical repair, can confirm elevated LA and pulmonary artery pressures, mitral gradient and valvearea.\\nPrognosis\\nThe natural history of MS varies, but the interval between onset of symptoms and severe disability isabout 7 to 9 yr.

Anticoagulants are indicated toprevent thromboembolism. All patients should be encouraged to continue at least low levels of physicalexercise despite exertional dyspnea.\\nMore severely symptomatic patients and patients with evidence of pulmonary hypertension requirevalvotomy, commissurotomy, or valve replacement.\\nPercutaneous balloon valvotomy is the procedure of choice for younger patients and for patients withoutheavily calcified valves, subvalvular distortion, LA thrombi, or significant MR. In this fluoroscopic- andechocardiographic-guided procedure, a transvenous catheter with an inflatable distal balloon is passedtransseptally from the right atrium to the LA and inflated to separate fused mitral valve leaflets. Outcomesare equivalent to those of more invasive procedures. Complications are uncommon but include MR,embolism, and tamponade.\\nPatients with severe subvalvular disease, valvular calcification, or LA thrombi may be candidates forsurgical commissurotomy, in which fused mitral valve leaflets are separated using a dilator passedthrough the LV (closed commissurotomy) via a thoracotomy, or by direct vision (open commissurotomy) viaa sternotomy. Choice of procedure is based on surgeon's experience and the morphology of the valve,although closed valvotomy is now done less frequently in Western countries.\\nValve replacement is confined to patients with severe morphologic changes that make the valveunsuitable for balloon or surgical valvotomy.\\nAntibiotic prophylaxis against endocarditis is no longer recommended except for patients who have hadvalve replacement (see Table 215-4 on p. 2200).\\nPulmonic Regurgitation\\nPulmonic (pulmonary) regurgitation (PR) is incompetency of the pulmonic valve causing bloodflow from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle during diastole. The most common causeis pulmonary hypertension. PR is usually asymptomatic. Signs include a decrescendo diastolicmurmur. Diagnosis is by echocardiography. Usually, no specific treatment is necessary exceptfor management of conditions causing pulmonary hypertension.\\nSecondary pulmonary hypertension (seeTable 202-1 on p. 1985) is by far the most common cause of PR. Less common causes are infectiveendocarditis, surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot, idiopathic pulmonary artery dilation, and congenitalvalvular heart disease. Carcinoid syndrome, rheumatic fever and catheter-induced trauma are rarecauses. Severe PR is rare and most often results from an isolated congenital defect involving dilation ofthe pulmonary artery and pulmonary valve annulus.\\nPR may contribute to development of right ventricular (RV) dilatation and eventually RV dysfunction-induced heart failure (HF), but in most cases, pulmonary hypertension contributes to this complicationmuch more significantly.

A few patients develop symptoms and signs of RV dysfunction-induced HF(see p. 2122).\\nPalpable signs are attributable to pulmonary hypertension and RV hypertrophy. They include a palpablepulmonic component (P2) of the 2nd heart sound (S2) at the left upper sternal border and a sustained RVimpulse that is increased in amplitude at the left middle and lower sternal border.\\nOn auscultation, the 1st heart sound (S1) is normal. The S2 may be split or single. When split, P2 may beloud and audible shortly after the aortic component of S2 (A2) because of pulmonary hypertension, or P2may be delayed because of increased RV stroke volume. S2 may be single because of prompt pulmonicvalve closing with a merged A2-P2 or, rarely, because of congenital absence of the pulmonic valve. An RV3rd heart sound (S3), 4th heart sound (S4), or both may be audible with RV dysfunction-induced HF orRV hypertrophy; these sounds can be distinguished from left ventricular heart sounds because they arelocated at the left parasternal 4th intercostal space and because they grow louder with inspiration.\\nThe murmur of PR due to pulmonary hypertension is a high-pitched, early diastolic decrescendo murmurthat begins with P2 and ends before S1 and that radiates toward the mid-right sternal edge (GrahamSteell's murmur); it is heard best at the left upper sternal border with the diaphragm of the stethoscopewhile the patient holds the breath at end-expiration and sits upright. The murmur of PR without pulmonaryhypertension is shorter, lower-pitched (rougher in quality), and begins after P2. Both murmurs mayresemble the murmur of aortic regurgitation but can be distinguished by inspiration (which makes the PRmurmur louder) and by Valsalva release. After Valsalva release, the PR murmur immediately becomes loud(because of immediate venous return to the right side of the heart), but the aortic regurgitation murmurrequires 4 or 5 beats to do so. Also, a soft PR murmur may sometimes become even softer duringinspiration because this murmur is usually best heard at the 2nd left intercostal space, where inspirationpushes the stethoscope away from the heart.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Echocardiography\\nPR is usually incidentally detected during a physical examination or Doppler echocardiography done forother reasons.

It commonly is a component of tetralogy of Fallot. Less commoncauses are Noonan's syndrome (a familial syndrome similar to Turner's syndrome but with nochromosomal defect) and carcinoid syndrome in adults.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMany children remain asymptomatic for years and do not present to a physician until adulthood. Eventhen many patients remain asymptomatic. When symptoms develop, they resemble those of aorticstenosis (syncope, angina, dyspnea). Visible and palpable signs reflect the effects of right ventricular(RV) hypertrophy and include a prominent jugular venous a wave (due to forceful atrial contractionagainst a hypertrophied RV), an RV precordial lift or heave, and a left parasternal systolic thrill at the 2ndintercostal space.\\nOn auscultation, the 1st heart sound (S1) is normal and the 2nd heart sound (S2) splitting is widenedbecause of prolonged pulmonic ejection (pulmonic component of S2 [P2] is delayed). In RV failure andhypertrophy, the 3rd and 4th heart sounds (S3 and S4) are rarely audible at the left parasternal 4thintercostal space. A click in congenital PS is thought to result from abnormal ventricular wall tension. Theclick occurs early in systole (very near S1) and is not affected by hemodynamic changes. A harshcrescendodecrescendo ejection murmur is audible and is heard best at the left parasternal 2nd (valvularstenosis) or 4th (infundibular stenosis) intercostal space with the diaphragm of the stethoscope when thepatient leans forward. Unlike the aortic stenosis murmur, a PS murmur does not radiate, and thecrescendo component lengthens as stenosis progresses. The murmur grows louder immediately withValsalva release and with inspiration; the patient may need to be standing for this effect to be heard.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Echocardiography\\nDiagnosis is confirmed by Doppler echocardiography, which can characterize the stenosis as mild (≤ 40mm Hg peak gradient), moderate (41 to 79 mm Hg), or severe (≥ 80 mm Hg). ECG is often part of theevaluation; it may be normal or show RV hypertrophy or right bundle branch block. Right heartcatheterization is indicated only when 2 levels of obstruction are suspected (valvular and infundibular),when clinical and echocardiographic findings differ, or before intervention is done.\\nTreatment\\n• Sometimes balloon valvuloplasty\\nPrognosis without treatment is generally good and improves with appropriate intervention. Treatment isballoon valvuloplasty, indicated for symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients with normal systolicfunction and a peak gradient > 40 to 50 mm Hg.\\nTricuspid Regurgitation\\nTricuspid regurgitation (TR) is insufficiency of the tricuspid valve causing blood flow from theright ventricle to the right atrium during systole. The most common cause is dilation of the rightventricle. Symptoms and signs are usually absent, but severe TR can cause neck pulsations, aholosystolic murmur, and right ventricular-induced heart failure or atrial fibrillation.

Acute or severe TR may cause symptoms of RV dysfunction-induced HF. Patients may alsodevelop symptoms of AF or atrial flutter.\\nPedal edema or ascites can occur in severe TR.\\nThe only visible sign of moderate to severe TR is jugular venous distention, with a prominent merged c-vwave and a steep y descent. In severe TR, a right jugular venous thrill may be palpable, as may systolichepatic pulsation and an RV impulse at the left lower sternal border. On auscultation, the 1st heart sound(S1) may be normal or barely audible if a TR murmur is present; the 2nd heart sound (S2) may be split(with a loud pulmonic component [P2] in pulmonary hypertension) or single because of prompt pulmonicvalve closing with merger of P2 and the aortic component (A2).

Medical treatment of causes(eg, HF, endocarditis) is indicated. The tricuspid valve may be repaired during surgery for left-sided heartlesions, such as mitral stenosis or regurgitation. Surgery may also be indicated for TR alone when RVimpairment or cirrhosis threatens.\\nSurgical options include annuloplasty, valve repair, and valve replacement. Annuloplasty, in which thetricuspid valve annulus is sutured to a prosthetic ring or a tailored reduction in annulus circumferentialsize is done, is indicated when TR is due to annular dilation. Valve repair or replacement is indicatedwhen TR is due to primary valve abnormalities or when annuloplasty is not technically feasible. Tricuspidvalve replacement is indicated when TR is due to carcinoid syndrome or Ebstein's anomaly. Abioprosthetic valve is used to reduce the risk of thromboembolism associated with the low pressures ofthe right heart; in the right heart, unlike the left heart, bioprosthetic valves last > 10 yr.\\nIf endocarditis has damaged the tricuspid valve and cannot be cured with antibiotics, the valve may betotally excised and not replaced until 6 to 9 mo later; this procedure is well tolerated.\\nTricuspid Stenosis\\nTricuspid stenosis (TS) is narrowing of the tricuspid orifice that obstructs blood flow from theright atrium to the right ventricle. Almost all cases result from rheumatic fever. Symptomsinclude a fluttering discomfort in the neck, fatigue, cold skin, and right upper quadrantabdominal discomfort. Jugular pulsations are prominent, and a presystolic murmur is oftenheard at the left sternal edge in the 4th intercostal space and is increased during inspiration.Diagnosis is by echocardiography. TS is usually benign, requiring no specific treatment, butsymptomatic patients may benefit from surgery.\\nTS is almost always due to rheumatic fever; tricuspid regurgitation is almost always also present, as is amitral valve disorder (usually mitral stenosis). Rare causes of TS include SLE, right atrial (RA) myxoma,congenital malformations, and metastatic tumors. The RA becomes hypertrophied and distended, andsequelae of right heart disease-induced heart failure develop but without right ventricular (RV)dysfunction; the RV remains underfilled and small. Uncommonly, atrial fibrillation occurs.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe only symptoms of severe TS are fluttering discomfort in the neck (due to giant a waves in the jugularpulse), fatigue and cold skin (due to low cardiac output), and right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort(due to an enlarged liver).\\nThe primary visible sign is a giant flickering a wave with gradual y descent in the jugular veins. Jugularvenous distention may occur, increasing with inspiration (Kussmaul's sign). The face may become duskyand scalp veins may dilate when the patient is recumbent (suffusion sign). Hepatic congestion andperipheral edema may occur.\\nOn auscultation, TS may produce a soft opening snap and a mid-diastolic rumble with presystolicaccentuation. The murmur becomes louder and longer with maneuvers that increase venous return(exercise, inspiration, leg-raising, Muller's maneuver) and softer and shorter with maneuvers thatdecrease venous return (standing, Valsalva maneuver).\\nFindings of TS often coexist with those of mitral stenosis and are less prominent.

Endocarditis\\nIntroduction\\nEndocarditis usually refers to infection of the endocardium (ie, infective endocarditis). The term can alsoinclude noninfective endocarditis, in which sterile platelet and fibrin thrombi form on cardiac valves andadjacent endocardium. Noninfective endocarditis sometimes leads to infective endocarditis. Both canresult in embolization and impaired cardiac function.\\nInfective Endocarditis\\nInfective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly,streptococci and staphylococci) or fungi. It causes fever, heart murmurs, petechiae, anemia,embolic phenomena, and endocardial vegetations. Vegetations may result in valvularincompetence or obstruction, myocardial abscess, or mycotic aneurysm. Diagnosis requiresdemonstration of microorganisms in blood and usually echocardiography. Treatment consists ofprolonged antimicrobial treatment and sometimes surgery.\\nEndocarditis can occur at any age. Men are affected about twice as often. IV drug abusers andimmunocompromised patients are at highest risk.\\nEtiology\\nThe normal heart is relatively resistant to infection. Bacteria and fungi do not easily adhere to theendocardial surface, and constant blood flow helps prevent them from settling on endocardial structures.Thus, 2 factors are generally required for endocarditis: a predisposing abnormality of the endocardiumand microorganisms in the bloodstream (bacteremia). Rarely, massive bacteremia or particularly virulentmicroorganisms cause endocarditis on normal valves.\\nEndocardial factors: Endocarditis usually involves the heart valves. Major predisposing factors arecongenital heart defects, rheumatic valvular disease, bicuspid or calcific aortic valves, mitral valveprolapse, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Prosthetic valves are a particular risk. Occasionally, muralthrombi, ventricular-septal defects, and patent ductus arteriosus sites become infected. The actual nidusfor infection is usually a sterile fibrin-platelet vegetation formed when damaged endothelial cells releasetissue factor.\\nInfective endocarditis occurs most often on the left side (eg, mitral or aortic valve). About 10 to 20% ofcases are right-sided (tricuspid or pulmonic valve). IV drug abusers have a much higher incidence ofright-sided endocarditis (about 30 to 70%).\\nMicroorganisms: Microorganisms that infect the endocardium may originate from distant infected sites(eg, cutaneous abscess, inflamed or infected gums, UTI) or have obvious portals of entry such as acentral venous catheter or a drug injection site. Almost any implanted foreign material (eg, ventricular orperitoneal shunt, prosthetic device) is at risk of bacterial colonization, thus becoming a source ofbacteremia and hence endocarditis. Endocarditis also may result from asymptomatic bacteremia, such astypically occurs during invasive dental, medical, or surgical procedures. Even toothbrushing and chewingcan cause bacteremia (usually due to viridans streptococci) in patients with gingivitis.\\nCausative microorganisms vary by site of infection, source of bacteremia, and host risk factors (eg, IVdrug abuse), but overall, streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus cause 80 to 90% of cases.Enterococci, gram-negative bacilli, HACEK organisms (Haemophilus sp, Actinobacillusactinomycetemcomitans, Cardio-bacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae—see p.1252), and fungi cause most of the rest. Why streptococci and staphylococci frequently adhere tovegetations and why gram-negative aerobic bacilli seldom adhere are unclear. However, the ability of S.aureus to adhere to fibronectin may play a role, as may dextran production by viridans streptococci.\\nAfter colonizing vegetations, microorganisms are covered by a layer of fibrin and platelets, which prevents\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 215.

Severevalvular regurgitation may develop suddenly, causing heart failure and death (usually due to mitral oraortic valve lesions). Aortitis may result from contiguous spread of infection. Prosthetic valve infectionsare particularly likely to involve valve ring abscesses, obstructing vegetations, myocardial abscesses, andmycotic aneurysms manifested by valve obstruction, dehiscence, and conduction disturbances.\\nSystemic consequences: Systemic consequences are primarily due to embolization of infected materialfrom the heart valve and, primarily in chronic infection, immune-mediated phenomena. Right-sided lesionstypically produce septic pulmonary emboli, which may result in pulmonary infarction, pneumonia, orempyema. Left-sided lesions may embolize to any tissue, particularly the kidneys, spleen, and CNS.Mycotic aneurysms can form in any major artery. Cutaneous and retinal emboli are common. Diffuseglomerulonephritis may result from immune complex deposition.\\nClassification\\nInfective endocarditis may have an indolent, subacute course or a more acute, fulminant course withgreater potential for rapid decompensation.\\nSubacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), although aggressive, usually develops insidiously andprogresses slowly (ie, over weeks to months). Often, no source of infection or portal of entry is evident.SBE is caused most commonly by streptococci (especially viridans, microaerophilic, anaerobic, andnonenterococcal group D streptococci and enterococci) and less commonly by S. aureus,Staphylococcus epidermidis, Gemella morbillorum, Abiotrophia defectiva, Granulicatella sp, andfastidious Haemophilus sp. SBE often develops on abnormal valves after asymptomatic bacteremia dueto periodontal, GI, or GU infections.\\nAcute bacterial endocarditis (ABE) usually develops abruptly and progresses rapidly (ie, over days). Asource of infection or portal of entry is often evident. When bacteria are virulent or bacterial exposure ismassive, ABE can affect normal valves. It is usually caused by S. aureus, group A hemolytic streptococci,pneumococci, or gonococci.\\nProsthetic valvular endocarditis (PVE) develops in 2 to 3% of patients within 1 yr after valvereplacement and in 0.5%/yr thereafter. It is more common after aortic than after mitral valve replacementand affects mechanical and bioprosthetic valves equally. Early-onset infections (< 2 mo after surgery) arecaused mainly by contamination during surgery with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (eg, S. epidermidis,diphtheroids, coliform bacilli, Candida sp, Aspergillus sp). Late-onset infections are caused mainly bycontamination with low-virulence organisms during surgery or by transient asymptomatic bacteremias,most often with streptococci; S. epidermidis; diphtheroids; and the fastidious gram-negative bacilli,Haemophilus sp, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Cardiobacterium hominis.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSymptoms and signs vary based on the classification but are nonspecific.\\nSBE: Initially, symptoms are vague: low-grade fever (< 39° C), night sweats, fatigability, malaise, andweight loss. Chills and arthralgias may occur. Symptoms and signs of valvular insufficiency may be a firstclue. Initially, ≤ 15% of patients have fever or a murmur, but eventually almost all develop both. Physicalexamination may be normal or include pallor, fever, change in a preexisting murmur or development of anew regurgitant murmur, and tachycardia.\\nRetinal emboli can cause round or oval hemorrhagic retinal lesions with small white centers (Roth's\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 215.

Cutaneous manifestations include petechiae (on the upper trunk, conjunctivae, mucousmembranes, and distal extremities), painful erythematous subcutaneous nodules on the tips of digits(Osler's nodes), nontender hemorrhagic macules on the palms or soles (Janeway lesions), and splinterhemorrhages under the nails. About 35% of patients have CNS effects, including transient ischemicattacks, stroke, toxic encephalopathy, and, if a mycotic CNS aneurysm ruptures, brain abscess andsubarachnoid hemorrhage. Renal emboli may cause flank pain and, rarely, gross hematuria. Splenicemboli may cause left upper quadrant pain. Prolonged infection may cause splenomegaly or clubbing offingers and toes.\\nABE and PVE: Symptoms and signs are similar to those of SBE, but the course is more rapid. Fever isalmost always present initially, and patients appear toxic; sometimes septic shock develops. Heart murmuris present initially in about 50 to 80% and eventually in > 90%. Rarely, purulent meningitis occurs.\\nRight-sided endocarditis: Septic pulmonary emboli may cause cough, pleuritic chest pain, andsometimes hemoptysis. A murmur of tricuspid regurgitation is typical.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Blood cultures\\n• Echocardiography\\n• Clinical criteria\\nBecause symptoms and signs are nonspecific, vary greatly, and may develop insidiously, diagnosisrequires a high index of suspicion. Endocarditis should be suspected in patients with fever and noobvious source of infection, particularly if a heart murmur is present. Suspicion of endocarditis should bevery high if blood cultures are positive in patients who have a history of a heart valve disorder, who havehad certain recent invasive procedures, or who abuse IV drugs. Patients with documented bacteremiashould be examined thoroughly and repeatedly for new valvular murmurs and signs of emboli.\\nIf endocarditis is suspected, 3 blood cultures (20 mL each) should be obtained within 24 h (if presentationsuggests ABE, 2 cultures within the first 1 to 2 h). When endocarditis is present and no prior antibiotictherapy was given, all 3 blood cultures usually are positive because the bacteremia is continuous; at leastone culture is positive in 99%. Premature use of empiric antibiotic therapy should be avoided in patientswith acquired or congenital valvular or shunt lesions to avoid culture-negative endocarditis. If priorantimicrobial therapy was given, blood cultures should still be obtained, but they may be negative.\\nEchocardiography, typically transthoracic (TTE) rather than transesophageal (TEE), should be done.Although TEE is somewhat more accurate (ie, capable of revealing vegetations too small to be seen onTTE), it is invasive and more costly. TEE should be done when endocarditis is suspected in patients withprosthetic valves, when TTE is nondiagnostic, and when diagnosis of infective endocarditis has beenestablished clinically.\\nOther than positive blood cultures, there are no specific laboratory findings. Established infections oftencause a normocytic-normochromic anemia, elevated WBC count, increased ESR, increased Igs,circulating immune complexes, and rheumatoid factor, but these findings are not diagnostically helpful.Urinalysis often shows microscopic hematuria and, occasionally, RBC casts, pyuria, or bacteriuria.\\nIdentification of the organism and its antimicrobial susceptibility is vital to guide treatment. Blood culturesmay require 3 to 4 wk incubation for certain organisms; however, some proprietary, automated culturemonitoring systems can identify positive cultures within a week. Other organisms (eg, Aspergillus sp) maynot produce positive cultures. Some organisms (eg, Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella sp, Chlamydia psittaci,Brucella sp) require serodiagnosis; others (eg, Legionella pneumophila) require special culture media orPCR (eg, Tropheryma whippelii). Negative blood culture results may indicate suppression due to priorantimicrobial therapy, infection with organisms that do not grow in standard culture media, or anotherdiagnosis (eg, non-infective endocarditis, atrial myxoma with embolic phenomena, vasculitis).\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 215.

Becausevegetations are not usually available for examination, clinical criteria for establishing a diagnosis (with asensitivity and specificity > 90%) have been developed (seeTable 215-1).\\nPrognosis\\nUntreated, infective endocarditis is always fatal. Even with treatment, death is more likely and theprognosis is generally poorer for older people and people who have infection with resistant organisms, anunderlying disorder, or a long delay in treatment. The prognosis is also poorer for people with aortic ormultiple valve involvement, large vegetations, polymicrobial bacteremia, prosthetic valve infections,mycotic aneurysms, valve ring abscess, and major embolic events. The mortality rate for viridansstreptococcal endocarditis without major complications is < 10% but is virtually 100% for Aspergillusendocarditis after prosthetic valve surgery.\\nThe prognosis is better with right-sided than left-sided endocarditis because tricuspid valve dysfunction istolerated better, systemic emboli are absent, and right-sided S. aureus endocarditis responds better toantimicrobial therapy.\\nTreatment\\n• IV antibiotics (based on the organism and its susceptibility)\\n• Sometimes valve debridement, repair, or replacement\\nTreatment consists of a prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy. Surgery may be needed formechanical complications or resistant organisms. Typically, antimicrobials are given IV. Because theymust be given for 2 to 8 wk, home IV therapy is often used.\\nAny apparent source of bacteremia must be managed: necrotic tissue dεbrided, abscesses drained, andforeign material and infected devices removed. Existing IV catheters (particularly central venous ones)should be changed. If endocarditis persists in a patient\\n[Table 215-1. Revised Duke Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Infective Endocarditis]\\nwith a newly inserted central venous catheter, that catheter should also be removed. Organisms withinbiofilms adherent to catheters and other devices may not respond to antimicrobial therapy, leading totreatment failure or relapse. If continuous infusions are used instead of intermittent boluses, infusionsshould not be interrupted for long periods.\\nAntibiotic regimens: Drugs and dosages depend on the microorganism and its antimicrobialsusceptibility (for typical regimens, seeTable 215-2). Initial therapy before organism identification (but after adequate blood cultures have beenobtained) should be broad spectrum to cover all likely organisms. Typically, patients with native valvesand no IV drug abuse receive ampicillin 500 mg/h continuous IV infusion plus nafcillin 2 g IV q 4 h plusgentamicin 1 mg/kg IV q 8 h. Patients with a prosthetic valve receive vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV q 12 h plusgentamicin 1 mg/kg q 8 h plus rifampin 300 po q 8 h. IV drug abusers receive nafcillin 2 g IV q 4 h. In allregimens, penicillin-allergic patients require substitution of vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV q 12 h.\\nIV drug abusers frequently do not adhere to treatment, abuse IV access lines, and tend to leave thehospital too soon. For such patients, short-course IV or (less preferably) oral therapy may be used. Forright-sided endocarditis caused by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, nafcillin 2 g IV q 4 h plus gentamicin 1mg/kg IV q 8 h for 2 wk is effective, as is a 4-wk oral regimen of ciprofloxacin 750 mg po bid plus rifampin300 mg po bid. Left-sided endocarditis does not respond to 2-wk courses.\\nCardiac valve surgery: Surgery (debridement, valve repair or replacement) is frequently required forabscess, persistent infection despite antimicrobial therapy (ie, persistent positive blood cultures or\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 215.

If heart failure caused by a correctable lesion isworsening (particularly when the organism is S. aureus, a gram-negative bacillus, or a fungus), surgerymay be required after only 24 to 72 h of antimicrobial therapy. In patients with prosthetic valves, surgerymay be required when TEE shows\\n[Table 215-2. Antibiotic Regimens for Endocarditis]\\nvalve dehiscence on a paravalvular abscess, when valve dysfunction precipitates heart failure, whenrecurrent emboli are detected, or when the infection is caused by an antimicrobial-resistant organism.\\nResponse to treatment: After starting therapy, patients with penicillin-susceptible streptococcalendocarditis usually feel better, and fever is reduced within 3 to 7 days. Fever may continue for reasonsother than persistent infection (eg, drug allergy, phlebitis, infarction due to emboli). Patients withstaphylococcal endocarditis tend to respond more slowly. Diminution of vegetation size can be followedby serial echocardiography.\\nRelapse usually occurs within 4 wk. Antibiotic retreatment may be effective, but surgery may also berequired. In patients without prosthetic valves, recrudescence of endocarditis after 6 wk usually resultsfrom a new infection rather than a relapse. Even after successful antimicrobial therapy, sterile emboli andvalve rupture may occur up to 1 yr later.\\nPrevention\\nPreventive dental examination and therapy before surgery to repair heart valves or congenital heartlesions is recommended.\\nPatients: The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends antimicrobial prophylaxis for patients athigh risk of an adverse outcome from infective endocarditis (see AHA guidelines). Such patients includethose with\\n• Prosthetic heart valves\\n• Previous infective endocarditis\\n• Certain congenital heart diseases (CHD): Unrepaired cyanotic CHD (including palliative shunts andconduits), completely repaired CHD during the first 6 mo after surgery if prosthetic material or devicewas used, repaired CHD that has residual defects at or adjacent to the site of repair\\n• Heart transplant recipients with valvulopathy\\nProcedures: Most procedures for which prophylaxis is required for high-risk patients are oral-dentalprocedures that manipulate the gingiva or the periapical region of teeth or perforate the oral mucosa.Other procedures include those respiratory tract procedures in which mucosa is incised, and GI, GU, ormusculo-skeletal procedures that involve an area with an established infection (seeTable 215-3).\\nAntibiotic regimens: For most patients and procedures, a single dose shortly before the procedure iseffective.\\nFor oral-dental and respiratory procedures, a drug effective against viridans group streptococci is used(seeTable 215-4).\\nFor GI, GU, and musculoskeletal procedures on areas involving infected tissue, antibiotics should beselected based on the known organism and its sensitivities.

Symptoms are those ofsystemic arterial embolism. Diagnosis is by echocardiography and negative blood cultures.Treatment consists of anticoagulants.\\nEtiology\\nVegetations are caused by physical trauma, not infection. They may be clinically undetectable or becomea nidus for infection (leading to infective endocarditis), produce emboli, or impair valvular function.\\nCatheters passed through the right side of the heart may injure the tricuspid and pulmonic valves,resulting in platelet and fibrin attachment at the site of injury. In disorders such as SLE, circulating immunecomplexes may result in friable platelet and fibrin vegetations along a valve leaflet closure (Libman-Sackslesions). These lesions do not usually cause significant valvular obstruction or regurgitation.Antiphospholipid syndrome (lupus anticoagulants, recurrent venous thrombosis, stroke, spontaneousabortions, livdo reticularis) also can lead to sterile endocardial vegetations and systemic emboli. Rarely,Wegener's granulomatosis leads to noninfective endocarditis.\\nMarantic endocarditis: In patients with chronic wasting diseases, disseminated intravascularcoagulation, mucin-producing metastatic carcinomas (of lung, stomach, or pancreas), or chronicinfections (eg, TB, pneumonia, osteomyelitis), large thrombotic vegetations may form on valves andproduce significant emboli to the brain, kidneys, spleen, mesentery, extremities, and coronary arteries.These vegetations tend to form on congenitally abnormal cardiac valves or those damaged by rheumaticfever.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nVegetations themselves do not cause symptoms. Symptoms result from embolization and depend on theorgan affected (eg, brain, kidneys, spleen). Fever and a heart murmur are sometimes present.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Blood cultures\\n• Echocardiography\\nNoninfective endocarditis should be suspected when chronically ill patients develop symptoms suggestingarterial embolism. Serial blood cultures (see p. 2195) and echocardiography should be done. Negativeblood cultures and valvular vegetations (but not atrial myxoma) suggest the diagnosis. Examination ofembolic fragments after embolectomy can help make the diagnosis. Differentiation from culture-negativeinfective endocarditis may be difficult but is important.

Pericarditis\\nIntroduction\\nPericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, often with fluid accumulation. Pericarditis maybe caused by many disorders (eg, infection, MI, trauma, tumors, metabolic disorders) but isoften idiopathic. Symptoms include chest pain or tightness, often worsened by deep breathing.Cardiac output may be greatly reduced. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, a friction rub, ECGchanges, and evidence of pericardial fluid accumulation on x-ray or echocardiogram. Findingthe cause requires further evaluation. Treatment depends on the cause, but general measuresinclude analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and sometimes surgery.\\nPericarditis is the most common pericardial disorder. Congenital pericardial disorders are rare.\\nAnatomy\\nThe pericardium has 2 layers. The visceral pericardium is a single layer of mesothelial cells that isattached to the myocardium, folds back (reflects) on itself over the origin of the great vessels, and joinswith a tough, fibrous layer to envelop the heart as the parietal pericardium. The sac created by theselayers contains a small amount of fluid (< 25 to 50 mL), composed mostly of an ultrafiltrate of plasma. Thepericardium limits distention of the cardiac chambers and increases the heart's efficiency.\\nThe pericardium is richly innervated with sympathetic and somatic afferents. Stretch-sensitivemechanoreceptors sense changes in cardiac volume and tension and may be responsible for transmittingpericardial pain. The phrenic nerves are embedded in the parietal pericardium and are vulnerable toinjury during surgery on the pericardium.\\nPathophysiology\\nPericarditis may be\\n• Acute\\n• Chronic\\nAcute pericarditis develops quickly, causing an inflammatory reaction. Chronic pericarditis (defined aspersisting > 6 mo) develops more slowly; its prominent feature is effusion. Acute disease may becomechronic. Adverse hemodynamic effects and rhythm disturbance are rare, although cardiac tamponade ispossible. Occasionally, pericarditis causes a marked thickening and stiffening of the pericardium(constrictive pericarditis). Pericarditis can lead to inflammation of the epicardial myocardium.\\nPericardial effusion is accumulation of fluid in the pericardium. The fluid may be serous fluid (sometimeswith fibrin strands), serosanguineous fluid, blood, pus, or chyle.\\nCardiac tamponade occurs when a large pericardial effusion impairs cardiac filling, leading to lowcardiac output and sometimes shock and death. If fluid (usually blood) accumulates rapidly, even smallamounts (eg, 150 mL) may cause tamponade because the pericardium cannot stretch quickly enough toaccommodate it. Slow accumulation of up to 1500 mL may not cause tamponade. Loculated effusion maycause localized tamponade on the right or left side of the heart.\\nConstrictive pericarditis, which is uncommon, results from marked inflammatory, fibrotic thickening ofthe pericardium. Sometimes the visceral and parietal layers adhere to each other or to the myocardium.The fibrotic tissue often contains Ca deposits. The stiff, thickened pericardium markedly impairsventricular filling, decreasing stroke volume and cardiac output. Significant pericardial fluid accumulationis rare. Rhythm disturbance is common. The diastolic pressures in the ventricles, atria, and venous bedsbecome virtually the same. Systemic venous congestion occurs, causing considerable transudation offluid from systemic capillaries, with dependent edema and, later, ascites. Chronic elevation of systemicvenous and hepatic venous pressure may lead to cardiac cirrhosis.

Infectious pericarditis is most often viral. Purulent bacterial pericarditis is uncommon butmay follow infective endocarditis, pneumonia, septicemia, penetrating trauma, or cardiac surgery. Often,the cause cannot be identified (called nonspecific or idiopathic pericarditis), but many of these cases areprobably viral. Overall, the most common causes are viral and idiopathic. Acute MI causes 10 to 15% ofcases of acute pericarditis. Post-MI syndrome (Dressler's syndrome) is a less common cause now,occurring mainly when reperfusion with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) orthrombolytic drugs is ineffective in patients with transmural infarction. Pericarditis occurs afterpericardiotomy (called postpericardiotomy syndrome) in 5 to 30% of cardiac operations.\\n[Table 216-1. Causes of Acute Pericarditis]\\nChronic pericardial effusion or constrictive pericarditis may follow almost any disorder that causes acutepericarditis, as well as TB, a tumor, irradiation, rheumatoid disease, and cardiac surgery. Sometimes nocause of chronic pericarditis is identified. Pericarditis with large effusion (serous, serosanguineous, orbloody) is most commonly caused by metastatic tumors, most often by lung or breast carcinoma, sarcoma,melanoma, leukemia, or lymphoma.\\nFibrosis of the pericardium may follow purulent pericarditis or myocardial infection (myocarditis—acommon cause in young people) or accompany a connective tissue disorder. In elderly patients, commoncauses are malignant tumors, MI, and TB. Hemopericardium (accumulation of blood within thepericardium) may lead to pericarditis or pericardial fibrosis; common causes include chest trauma,iatrogenic injury (eg, from cardiac catheterization, pacemaker insertion, or central venous line placement),and rupture of a thoracic aortic aneurysm.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSome patients present with symptoms and signs of inflammation (acute pericarditis); others present withthose of fluid accumulation (pericardial effusion). Symptoms and signs vary depending on the severity ofinflammation and the amount and rate of fluid accumulation. Even a large amount of pericardial fluid maybe asymptomatic if it develops slowly (eg, over months).\\nAcute pericarditis: Acute pericarditis tends to cause chest pain and a pericardial rub, sometimes withdyspnea. The first evidence can be tamponade, with hypotension, shock, or pulmonary edema.\\nBecause the innervation of the pericardium and myocardium is the same, the chest pain of pericarditis issometimes similar to that of myocardial inflammation or ischemia: Dull or sharp precordial or substernalpain may radiate to the neck, trapezius ridge (especially the left), or shoulders. Pain ranges from mild tosevere. Unlike ischemic chest pain, pain due to pericarditis is usually aggravated by thoracic motion,cough, breathing, or swallowing food; it may be relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. Tachypnea andnonproductive cough may be present; fever, chills, and weakness are common. In 15 to 25% of patientswith idiopathic pericarditis, symptoms recur intermittently for months or years.\\nThe most important physical finding is a triphasic or a systolic and diastolic precordial friction rub.However, the rub is often intermittent and evanescent; it may be present only during systole or, lessfrequently, only during diastole. If no rub is heard with the patient seated and leaning forward,auscultation may be attempted by listening with the diaphragm of the stethoscope while the patient is onall fours. Sometimes, a pleural component to the rub is noted during breathing, which is due toinflammation of the pleura adjacent to the pericardium. Considerable amounts of pericardial fluid maymuffle heart sounds, increase the area of cardiac dullness, and change the size and shape of the cardiacsilhouette.\\nPericardial effusion: Pericardial effusion is often painless, but when it occurs with acute pericarditis,\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 216.

Typically, heart sounds are muffled. A pericardial rub may be heard. With largeeffusions, compression of the base of the left lung can decrease breath sounds (heard near the leftscapula) and cause crackles. Arterial pulse, jugular venous pulse, and BP are normal unlessintrapericardial pressure increases substantially, causing tamponade.\\nIn the post-MI syndrome, pericardial effusion can occur with fever, friction rub, pleurisy, pleural effusions,and joint pain. This syndrome usually occurs within 10 days to 2 mo after MI. It is usually mild but may besevere. Occasionally, the heart ruptures post-MI, causing hemopericardium and tamponade, usually 1 to10 days post-MI and more commonly in women.\\nCardiac tamponade: The clinical findings are similar to those of cardiogenic shock: decreased cardiacoutput, low systemic arterial pressure, tachycardia, and dyspnea. Neck veins are markedly dilated.Severe cardiac tamponade is nearly always accompanied by a fall of > 10 mm Hg in systolic BP duringinspiration (pulsus paradoxus—see p. 2018). In advanced cases, pulse may disappear during inspiration.(However, pulsus paradoxus can also occur in COPD, bronchial asthma, pulmonary embolism, rightventricular infarction, and noncardiogenic shock.) Heart sounds are muffled unless the effusion is small.\\nConstrictive pericarditis: Fibrosis or calcification rarely causes symptoms unless constrictivepericarditis develops. The only early abnormalities may be elevated ventricular diastolic, atrial, pulmonary,and systemic venous pressures. Symptoms and signs of peripheral venous congestion (eg, peripheraledema, neck vein distention, hepatomegaly) may appear with an early diastolic sound (pericardial knock),often best heard during inspiration. This sound is due to abrupt slowing of diastolic ventricular filling bythe rigid pericardium. Ventricular systolic function (based on ejection fraction) is usually preserved.Prolonged elevation of pulmonary venous pressure results in dyspnea (particularly during exertion) andorthopnea. Fatigue may be severe. Distention of neck veins with a rise in venous pressure duringinspiration (Kussmaul's sign) is present; it is absent in tamponade. Pulsus paradoxus is rare and isusually less severe than in tamponade. Lungs are not congested unless severe left ventricularconstriction develops.\\nDiagnosis\\n• ECG and chest x-ray\\n• Echocardiography\\n• Tests to identify cause (eg, pericardial fluid aspiration, pericardial biopsy)\\nAcute pericarditis: If acute pericarditis is suspected, hospitalization is sometimes required for initialevaluation. ECG and chest x-ray are done. If symptoms or signs of elevated right-sided pressure,tamponade, or an enlarged cardiac silhouette are present, echocardiography to check for effusion andcardiac filling abnormalities is also done. Blood tests may detect leukocytosis and an elevated ESR, butthese findings are nonspecific.\\nThe diagnosis is based on the presence of typical clinical findings and ECG abnormalities. Serial ECGsmay be needed to show abnormalities.\\nThe ECG in acute pericarditis may show abnormalities confined to ST segments and T waves, usually inmost leads (seeFig. 216-1). The ST segments in 2 or 3 of the standard leads become elevated but subsequently return tobaseline. Unlike MI, acute pericarditis does not cause reciprocal depression in ST segments (except inleads aVR and V1), and there are no pathologic Q waves. The PR segment may be depressed. Afterseveral days or longer, T waves may become flattened and then inverted throughout the ECG, except inlead aVR; T wave-inversion occurs after the ST segment has returned to baseline and thus differs fromthe pattern of acute ischemia or MI.\\nBecause the pain of pericarditis may resemble that of acute MI or pulmonary infarction, additional tests(eg, serum cardiac marker measurement, lung scan) may be required if the history and ECG findings areatypical for pericarditis.

Pain, friction rub, and feverappearing 2 wk to several months after surgery and a rapid response to aspirin, NSAIDs, orcorticosteroids aid diagnosis.\\nPericardial effusion: Diagnosis is suggested by clinical findings but often is suspected only after findingan enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray. On ECG, QRS voltage is often decreased, and sinusrhythm remains in about 90% of patients. With large, chronic effusions, the ECG may show electricalalternans (ie, P, QRS, or T wave amplitude increases and decreases on alternate beats). Electricalalternans is associated with variation in cardiac position (swinging heart). Echocardiography has a highdegree of sensitivity and specificity for detecting pericardial fluid.\\nPatients with a normal ECG, small (< 0.5 L) effusion, and no suspicious findings from the history andexamination may be observed with serial examination and echocardiography. Other patients must beevaluated further to determine etiology.\\nConstrictive pericarditis: Diagnosis may be suspected based on ECG, chest x-ray, and Dopplerechocardiography findings, but cardiac catheterization and CT (or MRI) are usually required. Becauseventricular filling is restricted, ventricular pressure tracings show a sudden dip followed by a plateau(resembling a square root sign) in early diastole. Rarely, right heart biopsy is needed to exclude restrictivecardiomyopathy.\\nECG changes are nonspecific. QRS voltage is usually low. T waves are usually non-specificallyabnormal. Atrial fibrillation occurs in about one third of patients; atrial flutter is less common.\\nLateral chest x-rays often show pericardial calcification best, but the finding is nonspecific.\\nThe changes on echocardiogram are also nonspecific. When the right and left ventricular filling pressuresare equally elevated, Doppler echocardiography helps distinguish constrictive pericarditis from restrictivecardiomyopathy. During inspiration, mitral diastolic flow velocity usually falls > 25% in\\n[Fig. 216-1. Acute pericarditis: Stage 1 ECG.]\\nconstrictive pericarditis but < 15% in restrictive cardiomyopathy. In constrictive pericarditis, inspiratorytricuspid flow velocity increases more than it normally does, but it does not do so in restrictivecardiomyopathy. Determining tissue velocities at the mitral annulus may be helpful when excessively highleft atrial pressure blunts respiratory variation in transvalvular velocities.\\nIf clinical and echocardiographic findings suggest constrictive pericarditis, right heart cardiaccatheterization is done. It helps confirm and quantify the abnormal hemodynamics that define constrictivepericarditis: Mean pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure), pulmonaryartery diastolic pressure, right ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and mean right atrial pressure are all atabout 10 to 30 mm Hg. The pulmonary artery and right ventricular systolic pressures are normal ormodestly elevated, so that pulse pressures are small. In the atrial pressure curve, x and y descents aretypically accentuated; in the ventricular pressure curve, a diastolic dip occurs at the time of rapidventricular filling. These changes almost always occur with significant constrictive pericarditis.\\nRight ventricular systolic pressure of > 50 mm Hg often occurs in restrictive cardiomyopathy but less oftenin constrictive pericarditis. When the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure equals the right atrial meanpressure and an early diastolic dip in the ventricular pressure curve occurs with large x and y waves inthe right atrial curve, either disorder may be present.\\nCT or MRI can identify pericardial thickening > 5 mm. Such thickening with typical hemodynamic changescan confirm a diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis.

When tamponade is suspected, echocardiography is doneunless even a brief delay might be life threatening. Then pericardiocentesis is done immediately fordiagnosis and treatment. On an echocardiogram, respiratory variation of transvalvular and venous flowsand compression or collapse of right cardiac chambers in the presence of a pericardial effusion supportthe diagnosis.\\nIf tamponade is suspected, right heart (Swan-Ganz) catheterization may be done. In cardiac tamponade,there is no early diastolic dip in the ventricular pressure record. In the atrial pressure curve, x descent ispreserved and y descent is lost. In contrast, in severe congestive states due to dilated cardiomyopathy,pulmonary artery occlusion or left ventricular diastolic pressure usually exceeds right atrial mean pressureand right ventricular diastolic pressure by ≥ 4 mm Hg.\\nDiagnosis of cause: After pericarditis is diagnosed, tests to determine etiology and the effect on cardiacfunction are done. In a young, previously healthy adult who presents with a viral infection and pericarditis,an extensive evaluation is usually unnecessary. Differentiating viral from idiopathic pericarditis is difficult,expensive, and generally of little practical importance.\\nA biopsy of pericardial tissue or aspiration of pericardial fluid may be needed to establish a diagnosis.Acid-fast stains and cultures of pericardial fluid help identify infectious causes. Samples are examined formalignant cells. However, complete drainage of a newly identified pericardial effusion is usuallyunnecessary for diagnosis. Persistent (usually > 3 mo) or progressive effusion, particularly when theetiology is uncertain, also warrants pericardiocentesis.\\nThe choice between needle pericardiocentesis and surgical drainage depends on institutional resourcesand physician experience, the etiology of the effusion, the need for diagnostic tissue samples, and theprognosis of the patient. Needle pericardiocentesis is often best when the etiology is known or thepresence of tamponade is in question. Surgical drainage is best when the presence of tamponade iscertain but the etiology is unclear.\\nLaboratory tests of pericardial fluid other than culture and cytology are usually nonspecific.

Colchicine 1 mg/day (for 3 mo), added to NSAIDs or given alone, is effective forthe initial episode of pericarditis and helps prevent recurrences. The intensity of therapy is dictated by thepatient's distress. Severe pain may require opioids and corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 60 to 80 mg poonce/day for 1 wk, followed by rapid tapering of the dose).

Diseases of the Aorta and Its Branches\\nIntroduction\\nThe aorta originates at the left ventricle above the aortic valve (aortic root), travels upward (ascendingthoracic aorta) to the first branch of the aorta (brachiocephalic or innominate artery), arches up andbehind the heart (aortic arch), then turns downward distal to the left subclavian artery (descending aorta)through the thorax (thoracic aorta) and abdomen (abdominal aorta). The abdominal aorta ends by dividinginto the 2 common iliac arteries.\\nAneurysms\\nAneurysms are abnormal dilations of arteries caused by weakening of the arterial wall.Common causes include hypertension, atherosclerosis, infection, trauma, and hereditary oracquired connective tissue disorders. Aneurysms are usually asymptomatic but can cause painand lead to ischemia, thromboembolism, spontaneous dissection, and rupture, which may befatal. Diagnosis is by imaging tests (eg, ultrasonography, CT angiography, magnetic resonanceangiography, aortography). Treatment of unruptured aneurysms is with risk factor modification(eg, strict BP control) plus surveillance imaging or with open or endovascular stent-graftsurgery, depending on size and location of the aneurysm and presence of symptoms.Treatment of ruptured aneurysms is immediate repair by either an open surgical synthetic graftor an endovascular stent-graft.\\nAneurysms, defined as a ≥ 50% increase in arterial diameter compared with normal segments, result fromlocalized weakening of an arterial wall. True aneurysms involve all 3 layers of the artery (intima, media,and adventitia). A pseudoaneurysm (false aneurysm) is a communication between the arterial lumen andoverlying connective tissue resulting from arterial rupture; a blood-filled cavity forms outside the vesselwall and seals the leak as it thromboses. Aneurysms are classified as fusiform (circumferential wideningof the artery) or saccular (localized outpouchings of the artery wall). Thrombi that develop in layers(laminated thrombi) may line the walls of either type and are a sign that blood flow beyond the aneurysmis normal or near normal.\\nAneurysms may occur in any artery. Abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysms are most common andsignificant; aneurysms of the major branches (subclavian and splanchnic arteries) are much lesscommon. Aneurysms of the cerebrovascular system are discussed in Sidebar 173-1 on p. 1653.\\nAbdominal Aortic Aneurysms\\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) account for three fourths of aortic aneurysms and affect 0.5 to 3.2%of the population. Prevalence is 3 times greater in men. AAAs typically begin below the renal arteries butmay include renal arterial ostia; about 50% involve the iliac arteries. Generally, aortic diameter ≥ 3 cmconstitutes an AAA. Most AAAs are fusiform; some are saccular. Many are lined with laminated thrombi.AAAs involve all layers of the aorta and do not involve dissection; however, a thoracic aortic dissectionmay extend to the distal abdominal aorta.\\nEtiology\\nThe most common cause is weakening of the arterial wall, usually associated with atherosclerosis. Othercauses include trauma, vasculitis, cystic medial necrosis, and post-surgical anastomotic disruption.Uncommonly, syphilis and localized bacterial or fungal infection, typically due to sepsis or infectiveendocarditis, weaken the arterial wall and cause infected (mycotic) aneurysms.\\nSmoking is the strongest risk factor. Other risk factors include hypertension, older age (peak incidence atage 70 to 80), family history (in 15 to 25%), race (more common in whites than in blacks), and male sex.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMost AAAs are asymptomatic; symptoms and signs, when they do occur, may not be specific.

Rapidlyenlarging aneurysms that are about to rupture are frequently tender, but most aneurysms grow slowlywithout symptoms.\\nThe aneurysm may or may not be palpable as a pulsatile mass, depending on its size and patient habitus.The probability that a patient with a pulsatile palpable mass has an aneurysm > 3 cm is about 40%(positive predictive value). A systolic bruit may be audible over the aneurysm.\\nIf an AAA ruptures, patients who do not die immediately typically present with abdominal or back pain,hypotension, and tachycardia. They may have a history of recent upper abdominal trauma, often minimal,or isometric straining (eg, lifting a heavy object).\\nPatients with an occult AAA sometimes present with symptoms of complications (eg, extremity pain due toembolization of mural thrombi) or of the cause (eg, fever, malaise, or weight loss due to infection orvasculitis). Uncommonly, large AAAs cause disseminated intravascular coagulation, perhaps becauselarge areas of abnormal endothelial surface trigger rapid thrombosis and consumption of coagulationfactors.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Often incidental\\n• Confirmation by ultrasonography or CT\\n• Sometimes CT angiography or magnetic resonance angiography\\nMost AAAs are diagnosed incidentally when they are detected during physical examination or whenabdominal ultrasonography, CT, or MRI is done for other reasons. An AAA should be considered in elderlypatients who present with acute abdominal or back pain whether a palpable pulsatile mass is present ornot.\\nWhen symptoms or physical examination findings suggest AAA, abdominal ultra-sonography or CT isusually the test of choice. Symptomatic patients should have immediate testing to make the diagnosisbefore catastrophic rupture. For hemodynamically unstable patients with presumed rupture,ultrasonography provides bedside results more rapidly, but intestinal gas and distention may limit itsaccuracy. Laboratory tests, including CBC, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, PT, PTT, blood type and cross-match, are done in preparation for possible surgery.\\nIf rupture is not suspected, CT angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can moreprecisely characterize aneurysm size and anatomy. If thrombi line the aneurysm wall, CTA mayunderestimate true size; noncontrast CT may provide a more accurate estimate. Aortography is essentialif renal artery or aortoiliac disease is suspected or if correction with endovascular stent-grafts(endografts) is being considered.\\nPlain abdominal x-rays are neither sensitive nor specific; however, if obtained for other purposes, aorticcalcification may outline the aneurysm wall.

Without treatment,mortality rate approaches 100%. With open surgical treatment, mortality rate is about 50%; mortality withendovascular stent grafting is generally lower (20 to 30%). The mortality remains high because manypatients have coexisting coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral atherosclerosis. Patients who presentin hemorrhagic shock require fluid resuscitation (see p. 2297) and blood transfusions, but mean arterialpressure should not be elevated to > 70 to 80 mm Hg because bleeding may increase. Preoperativecontrol of hypertension is important.\\nElective surgical repair is recommended for aneurysms > 5 to 5.5 cm (when risk of rupture increases to >5 to 10%/yr), unless coexisting medical conditions contraindicate surgery. Additional indications forelective surgery include increase in aneurysm size by > 0.5 cm within 6 mo regardless of size, chronicabdominal pain, thromboembolic complications, and an iliac or femoral artery aneurysm that causeslower-limb ischemia. Before elective repair, clinical recognition of coronary artery disease (CAD) isessential (seeTable 207-1 on p. 2049) because many patients with an AAA have generalized atherosclerosis andsurgical repair poses a major risk of cardiovascular events. Aggressive medical treatment and risk factorcontrol are essential, and revascularization should be considered only in patients with unstable CAD.Routine preoperative coronary angioplasty or bypass surgery has not been shown to be necessary inmost patients who can be prepared with good medical management before aneurysm repair.\\n[Table 217-1. Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Size and Rupture Risk*]\\nSurgical repair consists of replacing the aneurysmal portion of the abdominal aorta with a synthetic graft.If the iliac arteries are involved, the graft must be extended to include them. If the aneurysm extendsabove the renal arteries, the renal arteries must be reimplanted into the graft, or bypass grafts must becreated.\\nPlacement of an endovascular stent-graft within the aneurysmal lumen via the femoral artery is a lessinvasive alternative and is indicated when risk of perioperative complications is high. This procedureexcludes the aneurysm from systemic blood flow and reduces risk of rupture. The aneurysm eventuallythromboses, and 50% of aneurysms decrease in diameter. Short-term results are good, but long-termresults are unknown. Complications include angulation, kinking, thrombosis, migration of the stent-graft,and endoleak (persistent flow of blood into the aneurysm sac after endovascular stent-graft placement).Thus, follow-ups must be more frequent after endovascular stent-graft placement than after a traditionalrepair. If no complications occur, imaging tests are recommended at 1 mo, 6 mo, 12 mo, and every yearthereafter. Complex anatomy (eg, short aneurysm neck below renal arteries, severe arterial tortuosity)makes endovascular stent grafting difficult in 30 to 40% of patients.\\nRepair of aneurysms < 5 cm does not appear to improve survival. These aneurysms should be monitoredwith ultrasonography every 6 to 12 mo for expansion that warrants treatment. Control of atheroscleroticrisk factors, especially smoking cessation and use of antihypertensives as appropriate, is important. If asmall or moderate-sized aneurysm becomes > 5.5 cm and if risk of perioperative complications is lowerthan estimated risk of rupture, AAA repair is indicated; risk of rupture vs that of perioperativecomplications should be discussed frankly with the patient.\\nTreatment of a mycotic aneurysm consists of vigorous antimicrobial therapy directed at the pathogen,followed by excision of the aneurysm. Early diagnosis and treatment improve outcome.\\nThoracic Aortic Aneurysms\\nThoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) account for one fourth of aortic aneurysms. Men and women areaffected equally. About 40% of TAAs occur in the ascending thoracic aorta (between the aortic valve andbrachiocephalic, or innominate, artery), 10% occur in the aortic arch (including the brachiocephalic,carotid, and subclavian arteries), 35% occur in the descending thoracic aorta (distal to the left subclavianartery), and 15% occur in the upper abdomen (as thoracoabdominal aneurysms).\\nEtiology\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 217.

Risk factors for both include prolonged hypertension, dyslipidemia,and smoking; additional risk factors for TAAs include presence of aneurysms elsewhere and older age(peak incidence at age 65 to 70).\\nCongenital connective tissue disorders (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) cause cysticmedial necrosis, a degenerative change that leads to TAAs complicated by aortic dissection (see p. 2212)and by widening of the proximal aorta and aortic valve (annuloaortic ectasia), which causes aorticregurgitation. Marfan syndrome causes 50% of cases of annuloaortic ectasia, but cystic medial necrosisand its complications can occur in young people even if no congenital connective tissue disorder ispresent.\\nInfected (mycotic) TAAs result from hematogenous spread of systemic or local infections (eg, sepsis,pneumonia), lymphangitic spread (eg, in TB), or direct extension (eg, in osteomyelitis or pericarditis).Bacterial endocarditis and tertiary syphilis are uncommon causes. TAAs occur in some connective tissuedisorders (eg, temporal arteritis, Takayasu's arteritis, Wegener's granulomatosis).\\nBlunt chest trauma causes pseudoaneurysms (extramural hematomas due to blood that has leakedthrough the torn aortic wall).\\nTAAs may dissect, compress or erode into adjacent structures, lead to thromboembolism, leak, or rupture.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMost TAAs are asymptomatic until complications (eg, thromboembolism, rupture, aortic regurgitation,dissection) develop. However, compression of adjacent structures can cause chest or back pain, cough,wheezing, dysphagia, hoarseness (due to left recurrent laryngeal or vagus nerve compression), chestpain (due to coronary artery compression), and superior vena cava syndrome. Erosion of aneurysms intothe lungs causes hemoptysis or pneumonitis; erosion into the esophagus (aortoesophageal fistula)causes massive hematemesis. Dissection manifests with tearing pain, often radiating to the back.Thromboembolism may cause stroke, abdominal pain (due to mesenteric embolism), or extremity pain.Patients who do not immediately die of a ruptured TAA present with severe chest or back pain andhypotension or shock; exsanguination most commonly occurs into the pleural or pericardial space.\\nAdditional signs include Horner syndrome due to compression of sympathetic ganglia, palpabledownward pull of the trachea with each cardiac contraction (tracheal tug), and tracheal deviation. Visibleor palpable chest wall pulsations, occasionally more prominent than the left ventricular apical impulse, areunusual but may occur.\\nSyphilitic aneurysms of the aortic root classically lead to aortic regurgitation and inflammatory stenosis ofthe coronary artery ostia, which may manifest as chest pain due to myocardial ischemia. Syphiliticaneurysms do not dissect.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Incidental x-ray finding\\n• Confirmation by CTA, MRA, or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)\\nTAAs are usually first suspected when a chest x-ray incidentally shows a widened mediastinum orenlargement of the aortic knob. These findings or symptoms and signs suggesting an aneurysm shouldbe followed up with a 3-dimensional imaging test. CTA can delineate aneurysm size and proximal ordistant extent, detect leakage, and identify coincident pathology. MRA may provide similar detail. TEE candelineate size and extent and detect leakage of aneurysms of the ascending but not descending aorta;TEE is especially useful for detecting aortic dissection. Contrast angiography provides the best image ofthe arterial lumen but no information on extraluminal structures, is invasive, and has a significant risk ofrenal and extremity atheroembolism and contrast nephropathy. Choice of imaging test is based onavailability and local experience; however, if rupture is suspected, TEE or CTA, depending on availability,is done immediately.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 217.

If amycotic aneurysm is suspected, bacterial and fungal blood cultures are done.\\nPrognosis\\nTAAs enlarge an average of 3 to 5 mm/yr; risk factors for rapid enlargement include larger size ofaneurysm, location in the descending aorta, and presence of mural thrombi. Median diameter ataneurysm rupture is 6 cm for ascending aneurysms and 7 cm for descending aneurysms, but rupture ofsmaller aneurysms may occur in patients with Marfan syndrome. Survival rate of patients with untreatedlarge TAAs is 65% at 1 yr and 20% at 5 yr.\\nTreatment\\n• Endovascular stent grafting or open surgical repair\\n• Control of hypertension\\nTreatment is endovascular stent grafting when anatomically possible and open surgical repair for morecomplex aneurysms. Immediate control of hypertension is essential.\\nRuptured TAAs, if untreated, are universally fatal; they require immediate intervention, as do leakinganeurysms and those that cause acute dissection or acute valvular regurgitation. Surgery involves amedian sternotomy (for ascending and aortic arch aneurysms) or left thoracotomy (for descending andthoracoabdominal aneurysms) and subsequent excision of the aneurysm and replacement with asynthetic graft. Transcatheter-placed endovascular stent-grafts (endografts) for descending TAAs arebeing used more frequently as a less invasive alternative to open surgery. With emergency surgery, 1-momortality rate is about 40 to 50%. In patients who survive, incidence of serious complications (eg, renalfailure, respiratory failure, severe neurologic damage) is high.\\nElective surgery is indicated for large aneurysms (diameter > 5 to 6 cm in the ascending aorta, > 6 to 7cm in the descending aorta, and, for patients with Marfan syndrome, > 5 cm in any location) and also forthose that rapidly enlarge (> 1 cm/yr). Elective surgery is also indicated for symptomatic, traumatic, orsyphilitic aneurysms. For syphilitic aneurysms, benzathine penicillin 2.4 million units once/wk IM is givenfor 3 wk afterward. For patients allergic to penicillin, tetracycline or erythromycin 500 mg po qid for 30days is acceptable.\\nAlthough surgical repair of an intact TAA improves outcome, mortality rate may still exceed 5 to 10% at 30days and is 40 to 50% at 10 yr. Risk of death increases greatly if aneurysms are complicated (eg, in theaortic arch or thoracoabdominal aorta) or if patients have CAD, are older, are symptomatic, or havepreexisting renal insufficiency. Perioperative complications (eg, stroke, spinal injury, renal failure) occur inabout 10 to 20%.\\nAsymptomatic aneurysms that do not meet criteria for elective surgical or endovascular repair are treatedwith aggressive BP control using a β-blocker and other antihypertensives if necessary. Smokingcessation is essential. Patients require frequent follow-ups to check for symptoms and serial CT every 6to 12 mo.\\nAortic Branch Aneurysms\\nAneurysms may occur in any major aortic branch; such aneurysms are much less common thanabdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysms. Risk factors include atherosclerosis, hypertension, cigarettesmoking, and older age. Localized infection can cause mycotic aneurysms.\\nSubclavian artery aneurysms are sometimes associated with cervical ribs or thoracic outlet syndrome.\\nSplanchnic artery aneurysms are uncommon.

Causes include medial fibromuscular dysplasia, portal hypertension, multiple pregnancies,penetrating or blunt abdominal trauma, pancreatitis, and infection. Hepatic artery aneurysms occur inmore men than women (2:1). They may result from previous abdominal trauma, illicit IV drug use, medialdegeneration of the arterial wall, or periarterial inflammation. Renal artery aneurysms may dissect orrupture, causing acute occlusion (see p. 2430).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSymptoms vary. Subclavian aneurysms can cause local pain, a pulsating sensation, venous thrombosis oredema (due to compression of adjacent veins), distal ischemic symptoms, transient ischemic attacks,stroke, or hoarseness or impaired motor and sensory function (due to compression of the recurrentlaryngeal nerve or brachial plexus). Superior mesenteric aneurysms may cause abdominal pain andischemic colitis.\\nRegardless of location, mycotic or inflammatory aneurysms may cause local pain and sequelae ofsystemic infection (eg, fever, malaise, weight loss).\\nDiagnosis\\n• Ultrasonography or CT\\nMost aortic branch aneurysms are not diagnosed before rupture, although calcified asymptomatic oroccult aneurysms may be seen on x-rays or other imaging tests done for other reasons. Ultrasonographyor CT is typically used to detect or confirm aortic branch aneurysms. Angiography can be used as neededto evaluate distal symptoms thought to be due to the aneurysm or embolism.\\nTreatment\\n• Open repair or sometimes endovascular stent grafting\\nTreatment is surgical removal and replacement with a graft. Endovascular repair is an option for somepatients. The decision to repair asymptomatic aneurysms is based on risk of rupture, extent and locationof the aneurysm, and perioperative risk.\\nSurgery for subclavian artery aneurysms may involve removal of a cervical rib (if present) before repairand replacement.\\nFor splanchnic aneurysms, risk of rupture and death is as high as 10% and is particularly high for womenof childbearing age and for patients with hepatic aneurysms (> 35%). Elective repair of splanchnicaneurysms is therefore indicated for women of childbearing age, for symptomatic aneurysms in other agegroups, and for hepatic aneurysms. For splenic aneurysms, repair may consist of ligation without arterialreconstruction or aneurysm exclusion and vascular reconstruction. Depending on location of theaneurysm, splenectomy may be necessary.\\nTreatment of mycotic aneurysms is aggressive antibiotic therapy directed at the specific pathogen.Generally, these aneurysms must also be surgically repaired.\\nAortic Dissection\\nAortic dissection is the surging of blood through a tear in the aortic intima with separation of theintima and media and creation of a false lumen. The intimal tear may be a primary event orsecondary to hemorrhage within the media. The dissection may occur anywhere along the aortaand extend proximally or distally into other arteries. Hypertension is an important contributor.Symptoms and signs include abrupt onset of tearing chest or back pain, and dissection mayresult in aortic regurgitation and compromised circulation in branch arteries. Diagnosis is byimaging tests (eg, transesophageal echocardiography, CT angiography, MRI, contrastaortography). Treatment always involves aggressive BP control and serial imaging to monitorprogression of dissection; surgical repair of the aorta and placement of a synthetic graft are\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 217.

One fifth of patients die before reaching the hospital, and up to onethird die of operative or perioperative complications.\\nEvidence of dissection is found in 1 to 3% of all autopsies. African-Americans, men, the elderly, andpeople with hypertension are especially at risk. Peak incidence occurs at age 50 to 65 or, for patients withcongenital connective tissue disorders (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), at age 20 to 40.\\nAortic dissections are classified anatomically. The DeBakey classification system is most widely used.\\n• Type I (50% of dissections): These dissections start in the ascending aorta and extend at least to theaortic arch and sometimes beyond.\\n• Type II (35%): These dissections start in and are confined to the ascending aorta.\\n• Type III (15%): These dissections start in the descending thoractic aorta just beyond the origin of the leftsubclavian artery and extend distally or, less commonly, proximally.\\n   The Stanford system is simpler.\\n• Type A: These dissections involve the ascending aorta.\\n• Type B: These dissections are confined to the descending thoracic aorta.\\nAlthough dissection may originate anywhere along the aorta, it occurs most commonly at the proximalascending aorta (within 5 cm of the aortic valve) or the descending thoracic aorta (just beyond the originof the left subclavian artery). Rarely, dissection is confined to individual arteries (eg, coronary or carotidarteries), typically in pregnant or postpartum women.\\nEtiology\\nAortic dissection always occurs in the setting of preexisting degeneration of the aortic media. Causesinclude connective tissue disorders and injury (seeTable 217-2).\\nAtherosclerotic risk factors, notably hypertension, contribute in more than two thirds of patients. Afterrupture of the intima, which is a primary event in some patients and secondary to hemorrhage within themedia in others, blood flows into the media, creating a false channel that extends distally or, lesscommonly, proximally along the artery.\\nPathophysiology\\nDissections may communicate back with the true aortic lumen through intimal rupture at a distal site,maintaining systemic blood flow. But serious consequences are common:\\n• Compromise of the blood supply of tributary arteries (including coronary arteries)\\n• Aortic valvular dilation and regurgitation\\n• Heart failure\\n• Fatal rupture of the aorta through the adventitia into the pericardium, right atrium, or left pleural space\\nAcute dissections and those present < 2 wk are most likely to cause these complications.

The pain frequently migrates from the original location as the dissection extends along the aorta.Up to 20% of patients present with syncope due to severe pain, aortic baroreceptor activation,extracranial cerebral artery obstruction, or cardiac tamponade.\\nOccasionally, patients present with symptoms of stroke, MI, intestinal infarction, paraparesis or paraplegiadue to interruption of the blood supply to the spinal cord, or ischemic limb due to acute distal arterialocclusion.\\nAbout 20% of patients have partial or complete deficits of major arterial pulses, which may wax and wane.Limb BPs may differ, sometimes by > 30 mm Hg; this finding suggests a poor prognosis. A murmur ofaortic regurgitation is heard in about 50% of patients with proximal dissection. Peripheral signs of aorticregurgitation may be present. Rarely, heart failure results from severe acute aortic regurgitation. Leakageof blood or inflammatory serous fluid into the left pleural space may lead to signs of pleural effusion;occlusion of a limb artery may cause signs of peripheral ischemia or neuropathy.

Such patients require a chest x-ray; in 60 to 90%, the mediastinal shadow is widened,usually with a localized bulge signifying the site of origin. Left pleural effusion is common.\\nIf chest x-ray suggests dissection, TEE, CTA, or MRA is done immediately after the patient is stabilized.Findings of an intimal flap and double lumina confirm dissection.\\nMultiplanar TEE is 97 to 99% sensitive and, with M-mode echocardiography, is nearly 100% specific. Itcan be done at the bedside in < 20 min and does not require contrast agents. If TEE is unavailable, CTAis recommended; it has a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 86%.\\nMRA has nearly 100% sensitivity and specificity for aortic dissection. But it is time-consuming and ill-suited for emergencies. It is probably best used for stable patients with sub-acute or chronic chest painwhen dissection is suspected.\\nContrast aortography is an option if surgery is being considered. In addition to identifying the origin andextent of dissection, severity of aortic regurgitation, and extent of involvement of the aorta's majorbranches, aortography helps determine whether simultaneous coronary artery bypass surgery is needed.Echocardiography should also be done to check for aortic regurgitation and thus determine whether theaortic valve should be repaired or replaced concomitantly.\\nECG is nearly universally done. However, findings range from normal to markedly abnormal (in acutecoronary artery occlusion or aortic regurgitation), so the test is not diagnostically helpful.

A β-blocker is usually used first. Options include metoprolol 5 mgIV up to 4 doses 15 min apart, esmolol 50 to 200 μg/kg/min in a constant IV infusion, and labetalol (an α-and β-adrenergic blocker) 1 to 2 mg/min in a constant IV infusion or 5 to 20 mg IV initial bolus withadditional doses of 20 to 40 mg given q 10 to 20 min until BP is controlled or a total of 300 mg has beengiven, followed by additional 20- to 40-mg doses q 4 to 8 h prn. Alternatives to β-blockers include Cachannel blockers (eg, verapamil 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg IV bolus or diltiazem 0.25 mg/kg [up to 25 mg] IV bolusor 5 to 10 mg/h by continuous infusion).\\nIf systolic BP remains > 110 mm Hg despite use of β-blockers, nitroprusside in a constant IV infusion canbe started at 0.2 to 0.3 μg/kg/min and titrated upward (often to 200 to 300 μg/min) as necessary to controlBP. Nitroprusside should not be given without a β-blocker or Ca channel blocker, because reflexsympathetic activation in response to vasodilation can increase ventricular inotropy and aortic shearstress, worsening the dissection.\\nA trial of drug therapy alone is appropriate for uncomplicated, stable dissection confined to thedescending aorta (type B) and for stable, isolated dissection of the aortic arch. Surgery is virtually alwaysindicated if dissection involves the proximal aorta. Surgery is also indicated for limb or visceral ischemia,uncontrolled hypertension, continued aortic enlargement, extension of the dissection, and evidence ofaortic rupture, regardless of dissection type. Surgery may also be best for acute distal dissections inpatients with Marfan syndrome.\\nThe goal of surgery is to obliterate entry into the false channel and reconstitute the aorta with a syntheticgraft. If present, significant aortic regurgitation must be treated by resuspending the aortic leaflets orreplacing the valve. Surgical outcomes are best with early, aggressive intervention; mortality rate rangesfrom 7 to 36%. Predictors of poor outcome include hypotension, renal failure, age > 70, abrupt onset ofchest pain, pulse deficit, and ST-segment elevation on ECG.\\nStent-grafts that seal entry to the false lumen and improve patency of the true lumen, balloon fenestration(in which an opening is made in the dissection flap that separates the true and false lumina), or both may\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 217.

It is also a feature of Cogan's syndrome (inflammatory keratitis,vestibular and auditory dysfunction, and aortitis).\\nInflammation usually involves all layers of the aorta (intima, media, adventitia) and may lead to occlusionof the aorta or its branches or weakening of the arterial wall, resulting in aneurysms. Pathogenesis,symptoms and signs, diagnosis, and treatment differ by etiology.\\nAbdominal Aortic Branch Occlusion\\nVarious branches of the aorta can be occluded by atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, orother conditions, causing symptoms and signs of ischemia or infarction. Diagnosis is byimaging tests. Treatment is with embolectomy, angioplasty, or sometimes surgical bypassgrafting.\\nAcute occlusion of branches of the abdominal aorta may result from embolism, atherothrombosis, ordissection; chronic occlusion may result from atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, or externalcompression by mass lesions.

Patients become fearful of eating; weight loss, often extreme, iscommon. Rarely, malabsorption develops and contributes to weight loss. Patients may have an abdominalbruit, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, and dark stools.\\nAcute renal artery embolism causes sudden flank pain, followed by hematuria (see p. 2430). Chronicocclusion may be asymptomatic or result in new or hard-to-control hypertension and other sequelae ofrenal insufficiency or failure.\\nAcute occlusion of the aortic bifurcation or distal branches can cause sudden onset of pain at rest, pallor,paralysis, absence of peripheral pulses, and coldness in the legs (see p. 2221). Chronic occlusion cancause intermittent claudication in the legs and buttocks and erectile dysfunction (Leriche syndrome).Femoral pulses are absent.

The digitsand hands or feet are persistently cold and bluish, sweat profusely, and may swell. In acrocyanosis, unlikeRaynaud's syndrome, cyanosis persists and is not easily reversed, trophic changes and ulcers do notoccur, and pain is absent. Pulses are normal.\\nTreatment, other than reassurance and avoidance of cold, is usually unnecessary. Vasodilators may betried but are usually ineffective.\\nErythromelalgia\\nErythromelalgia is distressing paroxysmal vaso-dilation of small arteries in the feet and handsand, less commonly, in the face, ears, or knees; it causes burning pain, increased skintemperature, and redness.\\nThis rare disorder may be primary (cause unknown) or secondary to myeloproliferative disorders (eg,polycythemia vera, thrombocythemia), hypertension, venous insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, SLE, RA,lichen sclerosus, gout, spinal cord disorders, or multiple sclerosis. Less commonly, the disorder is relatedto the use of some drugs (eg, nifedipine, bromocriptine). A rare hereditary form of erythromelalgia starts atbirth or during childhood.\\nBurning pain, heat, and redness in the feet or hands last a few minutes to several hours. In most patients,symptoms are triggered by warmth (temperatures of 29 to 32° C) and are typically relieved by immersionin ice water. Trophic changes do not occur. Symptoms may remain mild for years or become severeenough to cause total disability. Generalized vasomotor dysfunction is common, and Raynaud's syndromemay occur.\\nDiagnosis is clinical. Testing is done to detect causes. Because erythromelalgia may precede amyeloproliferative disorder by several years, repeated blood counts may be indicated. Differentialdiagnosis includes posttraumatic reflex dystrophies, shoulder-hand syndrome, peripheral neuropathy,causalgia, Fabry's disease, and bacterial cellulitis.\\nTreatment is warmth avoidance, rest, elevation of the extremity, and application of cold. For primaryerythromelalgia, gabapentin may be of benefit. For secondary erythromelalgia, the underlying disorder istreated; aspirin may be helpful when a myeloproliferative disorder is involved.\\nFibromuscular Dysplasia\\nFibromuscular dysplasia includes a heterogenous group of nonatherosclerotic,noninflammatory arterial changes, causing some degree of vascular stenosis, occlusion, oraneurysm.\\nFibromuscular dysplasia usually occurs in women aged 40 to 60. The cause is unknown. However, theremay be a genetic component, and smoking may be a risk factor.

It may involve percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, bypass surgery, oraneurysm repair. Smoking cessation is important. Control of other risk factors for atherosclerosis(hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes) helps prevent accelerated development of flow-limiting arterialstenoses.\\nPeripheral Arterial Aneurysms\\nPeripheral arterial aneurysms are abnormal dilations of the peripheral arteries caused byweakening of the arterial wall (see also p. 2207).\\nAbout 70% of peripheral arterial aneurysms are popliteal aneurysms; 20% are iliofemoral aneurysms.Aneurysms at these locations frequently accompany abdominal aortic aneurysms, and > 50% arebilateral. Rupture is relatively infrequent, but these aneurysms may lead to thromboembolism. They occurin men much more often than women (> 20:1); mean age at presentation is 65. Aneurysms in arm arteriesare relatively rare; they may cause limb ischemia, distal embolism, and stroke.\\nInfectious (mycotic) aneurysms may occur in any artery but are most common in the femoral. They areusually due to salmonellae, staphylococci, or Treponema pallidum (which causes syphilitic aneurysm).\\nCommon causes include atherosclerosis, popliteal artery entrapment, and septic emboli (which causemycotic aneurysms).\\nPeripheral arterial aneurysms are usually asymptomatic at the time of detection. Thrombosis or embolism(or rarely, aneurysm rupture) causes extremities to be painful, cold, pale, paresthetic, or pulseless.Infectious aneurysms may cause local pain, fever, malaise, and weight loss.\\nDiagnosis is by ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography, or CT. Popliteal aneurysms may besuspected when physical examination detects an enlarged, pulsatile artery; the diagnosis is confirmed byimaging tests.\\nRisk of rupture of extremity aneurysms is low (< 5% for popliteal and 1 to 14% for iliofemoral aneurysms).For leg artery aneurysms, surgical repair is therefore often elective.

Limb salvage rate after surgical repair is 90 to 98%for asymptomatic patients and 70 to 80% for symptomatic patients.\\nIn certain patients, an endovascular-covered stent-graft is another option for repair.\\nPeripheral Arterial Disease\\n(Peripheral Vascular Disease)\\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is atherosclerosis of the extremities (virtually always lower)causing ischemia. Mild PAD may be asymptomatic or cause intermittent claudication; severePAD may cause rest pain with skin atrophy, hair loss, cyanosis, ischemic ulcers, and gangrene.Diagnosis is by history, physical examination, and measurement of the ankle-brachial index.Treatment of mild PAD includes risk factor modification, exercise, antiplatelet drugs, andcilostazol or possibly pentoxifylline as needed for symptoms. Severe PAD usually requiresangioplasty or surgical bypass and may require amputation. Prognosis is generally good withtreatment, although mortality rate is relatively high because coronary artery or cerebrovasculardisease often coexists.\\nEtiology\\nPAD affects about 12% of people in the US; men are affected more commonly. Risk factors are the sameas those for atherosclerosis: hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia (high low-density lipoprotein [LDL]cholesterol, low high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol), cigarette smoking (including passive smoking)or other forms of tobacco use, diabetes, and a family history of atherosclerosis. Obesity, male sex, and ahigh homocysteine level are also risk factors.\\nAtherosclerosis is a systemic disorder; 50 to 75% of patients with PAD also have clinically significantcoronary artery disease (CAD) or cerebrovascular disease. However, CAD may be silent because PADmay prevent patients from exerting themselves enough to trigger angina.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nTypically, PAD causes intermittent claudication, which is a painful, aching, cramping, uncomfortable, ortired feeling in the legs that occurs during walking and is relieved by rest. Claudication usually occurs inthe calves but can occur in the feet, thighs, hips, buttocks, or, rarely, arms. Claudication is a manifestationof exercise-induced reversible ischemia, similar to angina pectoris. As PAD progresses, the distance thatcan be walked without symptoms may decrease, and patients with severe PAD may experience painduring rest, reflecting irreversible ischemia. Rest pain is usually worse distally, is aggravated by legelevation (often causing pain at night), and lessens when the leg is below heart level. The pain may beburning, tightening, or aching, although this finding is nonspecific. About 20% of patients with PAD areasymptomatic, sometimes because they are not active enough to trigger leg ischemia. Some patientshave atypical symptoms (eg, nonspecific exercise intolerance, hip or other joint pain).\\nMild PAD often causes no signs. Moderate to severe PAD commonly causes diminished or absentperipheral (popliteal, tibialis posterior, dorsalis pedis) pulses; Doppler ultra-sonography can often detectblood flow when pulses cannot be palpated.\\nWhen below heart level, the foot may appear dusky red (called dependent rubor). In some patients,elevating the foot causes loss of color and worsens ischemic pain; when the foot is lowered, venous fillingis prolonged (> 15 sec). Edema is usually not present unless the patient has kept the leg immobile and ina dependent position to relieve pain. Patients with chronic PAD may have thin, pale (atrophic) skin withhair thinning or loss. Distal legs and feet may feel cool. The affected leg may sweat excessively andbecome cyanotic, probably because of sympathetic nerve overactivity.\\nAs ischemia worsens, ulcers may appear (typically on the toes or heel, occasionally on the leg or foot),especially after local trauma. The ulcers tend to be surrounded by black, necrotic tissue (dry gangrene).\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 218.

Infection of ischemic ulcers (wet gangrene) occurs readily, causing rapidly progressive cellulitis.\\nThe level of arterial occlusion influences location of symptoms. Aortoiliac PAD may cause buttock, thigh,or calf claudication; hip pain; and, in men, erectile dysfunction (Leriche syndrome). In femoropoplitealPAD, claudication typically occurs in the calf; pulses below the femoral artery are weak or absent. In PADof more distal arteries, femoropopliteal pulses may be present, but foot pulses are absent.\\nArterial occlusive disease occasionally affects the arms, especially the left proximal subclavian artery,causing arm fatigue with exercise and occasionally embolization to the hands.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Ankle-brachial BP index\\n• Ultrasonography\\n• Angiography before surgery\\nPAD is suspected clinically but is under-recognized because many patients have atypical symptoms or arenot active enough to have symptoms. Spinal stenosis may also cause leg pain during walking but can bedistinguished because the pain (called pseudo-claudication) requires sitting, not just rest, for relief, anddistal pulses remain intact.\\nDiagnosis is confirmed by noninvasive testing. First, bilateral arm and ankle systolic BP is measured;because ankle pulses may be difficult to palpate, a Doppler probe may be placed over the dorsalis pedisor posterior tibial arteries. Doppler ultrasonography is often used, because pressure gradients and pulsevolume waveforms can help distinguish isolated aortoiliac PAD from femoropopliteal PAD and below-the-knee PAD.\\nA low (≤ 0.90) ankle-brachial index (ratio of ankle to arm systolic BP) indicates PAD, which can beclassified as mild (0.71 to 0.90), moderate (0.41 to 0.70), or severe (≤ 0.40). If the index is normal (0.91 to1.30) but suspicion of PAD remains high, the index is determined after exercise stress testing. A highindex (> 1.30) may indicate noncompressible leg vessels (as occurs in Monckeberg's arteriosclerosis withcalcification of the arterial wall). If the index is > 1.30 but suspicion of PAD remains high, additional tests(eg, Doppler ultrasonography, measurement of BP in the first toe using toe cuffs) are done to check forarterial stenoses or occlusions. Ischemic lesions are unlikely to heal when systolic BP is < 55 mm Hg inpatients without diabetes or < 70 mm Hg in patients with diabetes; below-the-knee amputations usuallyheal if BP is ≥ 70 mm Hg. Peripheral arterial insufficiency can also be assessed by transcutaneousoximetry (TcO2). A TcO2 level < 40 mm Hg is predictive of poor healing, and a value < 20 mm Hg isconsistent with critical limb ischemia.\\nAngiography provides details of the location and extent of arterial stenoses or occlusion; it is aprerequisite for surgical correction or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). It is not a substitutefor noninvasive testing because it provides no information about the functional significance of abnormalfindings.

It can increase symptom-free walking distance and improvequality of life. Mechanisms probably include increased collateral circulation, improved endothelial functionwith microvascular vasodilation, decreased blood viscosity, improved RBC filterability, decreasedischemia-induced inflammation, and improved O2 extraction.\\nPatients are advised to keep the legs below heart level. For pain relief at night, the head of the bed canbe elevated about 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 inches) to improve blood flow to the feet.\\nPatients are also advised to avoid cold and drugs that cause vasoconstriction (eg, pseudoephedrine,contained in many sinus and cold remedies).\\nPreventive foot care is crucial, especially for patients with diabetes. It includes daily foot inspection forinjuries and lesions; treatment of calluses and corns by a podiatrist; daily washing of the feet in lukewarmwater with mild soap, followed by gentle, thorough drying; and avoidance of thermal, chemical, andmechanical injury, especially that due to poorly fitting footwear. For foot ulcer management, see also p.740.\\nAntiplatelet drugs may modestly lessen symptoms and improve walking distance; more importantly, thesedrugs modify atherogenesis and help prevent acute coronary syndromes (see p. 2109) and transientischemic attacks (see p. 1651). Options include aspirin 81 to 162 mg once/day, aspirin 25 mg plusdipyridamole 200 mg po once/day, and clopidogrel 75 mg po once/day or ticlopidine 250 mg po bid with orwithout aspirin. Aspirin is typically used alone first, followed by addition or substitution of other drugs ifPAD progresses.\\nFor relief of claudication, pentoxifylline 400 mg po tid with meals or cilostazol 100 mg po bid may be usedto relieve intermittent claudication by improving blood flow and enhancing tissue oxygenation in affectedareas; however, these drugs are no substitute for risk factor modification and exercise. Use ofpentoxifylline is controversial because evidence of its effectiveness is mixed. A trial of ≥ 2 mo may bewarranted, because adverse effects are uncommon and mild. The most common adverse effects ofcilostazol are headache and diarrhea. Cilostazol is contraindicated by severe heart failure.\\nOther drugs that may relieve claudication are being studied; they include L-arginine (the precursor ofendothelium-dependent vasodilator), nitric oxide, vasodilator prostaglandins, and angiogenic growthfactors (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF]). Genetherapy for PAD is also being studied. In patients with severe limb ischemia, long-term parenteral use ofvasodilator prostaglandins may decrease pain and facilitate ulcer healing, and intramuscular genetransfer of DNA encoding VEGF may promote collateral blood vessel growth.\\nPercutaneous transluminal intervention: PTA with or without stent insertion is the primary nonsurgicalmethod for dilating vascular occlusions. PTA with stent insertion may keep the artery open better thanballoon compression alone, with a lower rate of reocclusion. Stents work best in large arteries with highflow (iliac and renal); they are less useful for smaller arteries and for long occlusions.\\nIndications for PTA are similar to those for surgery: intermittent claudication that inhibits daily activities,rest pain, and gangrene. Suitable lesions are flow-limiting, short iliac stenoses (< 3 cm) and short, singleor multiple stenoses of the superficial femoropopliteal segment. Complete occlusions (up to 10 or 12 cmlong) of the superficial femoral artery can be successfully dilated, but results are better for occlusions ≤ 5cm. PTA is also useful for localized iliac stenosis proximal to a bypass of the femoropopliteal artery.\\nPTA is less useful for diffuse disease, long occlusions, and eccentric calcified plaques.

Because many patients have underlying CAD, which places them at risk of acutecoronary syndromes during surgical procedures for PAD, patients usually undergo cardiac evaluationprior to surgery.\\nThromboendarterectomy (surgical removal of an occlusive lesion) is used for short, localized lesions inthe aortoiliac, common femoral, or deep femoral arteries.\\nRevascularization (eg, femoropopliteal bypass grafting) uses synthetic or natural materials (often thesaphenous or another vein) to bypass occlusive lesions. Revascularization helps prevent limb amputationand relieve claudication.\\nIn patients who cannot undergo major vascular surgery, sympathectomy may be effective when a distalocclusion causes severe ischemic pain. Chemical sympathetic blocks are as effective as surgicalsympathectomy, so the latter is rarely done.\\nAmputation is a procedure of last resort, indicated for uncontrolled infection, unrelenting rest pain, andprogressive gangrene. Amputation should be as distal as possible, preserving the knee for optimal usewith a prosthesis.\\nExternal compression therapy: External pneumatic compression of the lower limb to increase distalblood flow is an option for limb salvage in patients who have severe PAD and are not candidates forsurgery. Theoretically, it controls edema and improves arterial flow, venous return, and tissueoxygenation, but data supporting its use are lacking. Pneumatic cuffs or stockings are placed on the lowerleg and inflated rhythmically during diastole, systole, or part of both periods for 1 to 2 h several times/wk.\\nAcute Peripheral Arterial Occlusion\\nPeripheral arteries may be acutely occluded by a thrombus, an embolus, aortic dissection, oracute compartment syndrome.\\nAcute peripheral arterial occlusion may result from rupture and thrombosis of an atherosclerotic plaque,an embolus from the heart or thoracic or abdominal aorta, an aortic dissection, or acute compartmentsyndrome (see p. 3213).\\nSymptoms and signs are sudden onset in an extremity of the 5 P's: severe pain, polar sensation(coldness), paresthesias (or anesthesias), pallor, and pulselessness. The occlusion can be roughlylocalized to the arterial bifurcation just distal to the last palpable pulse (eg, at the common femoralbifurcation when the femoral pulse is palpable; at the popliteal bifurcation when the popliteal pulse ispalpable). Severe cases may cause loss of motor function. After 6 to 8 h, muscles may be tender whenpalpated.\\nDiagnosis is clinical. Immediate angiography is required to confirm location of the occlusion, identifycollateral flow, and guide therapy.\\nTreatment consists of embolectomy (catheter or surgical), thrombolysis, or bypass surgery. The decisionto do surgical thromboembolectomy vs thrombolysis is based on the severity of ischemia, the extent orlocation of the thrombus, and the general medical condition of the patient.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 218.

Treatment is usually continued for 4 to 24 h, depending on severity of ischemia and signs ofthrombolysis (relief of symptoms and return of pulses or improved blood flow shown by Dopplerultrasonography). About 20 to 30% of patients with acute arterial occlusion require amputation within thefirst 30 days.\\nRaynaud's Syndrome\\nRaynaud's syndrome is vasospasm of parts of the hand in response to cold or emotional stress,causing reversible discomfort and color changes (pallor, cyanosis, erythema, or a combination)in one or more digits. Occasionally, other acral parts (eg, nose, tongue) are affected. Thedisorder may be primary or secondary. Diagnosis is clinical; testing focuses on distinguishingprimary from secondary disease. Treatment of uncomplicated cases includes avoidance ofcold, biofeedback, smoking cessation, and, as needed, vasodilating Ca channel blockers (eg,nifedipine) or prazosin.\\nOverall prevalence is about 3 to 5%; women are affected more than men, and younger people areaffected more than older people. Raynaud's syndrome is probably due to an exaggerated α2-adrenergicresponse that triggers vasospasm; the mechanism is not defined.\\nPrimary Raynaud's syndrome is much more common (> 80% of cases) than secondary; it occurs withoutsymptoms or signs of other disorders. In the remaining 20% of patients with Raynaud's symptoms, acausative underlying disease (eg, systemic sclerosis) will be evident at initial presentation or diagnosedsubsequently.\\nSecondary Raynaud's syndrome accompanies various disorders and conditions, mostly connective tissuedisorders (seeTable 218-1).\\nNicotine commonly contributes to it but is often overlooked. Raynaud's syndrome may accompanymigraine headaches, variant angina, and pulmonary hypertension, suggesting that these disorders sharea common vasospastic mechanism.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSensations of coldness, burning pain, paresthesias, or intermittent color changes of one or more digitsare precipitated by exposure to cold, emotional stress, or vibration. All can be reversed by removing thestimulus. Re-warming the hands accelerates restoration of normal color and sensation.\\nColor changes are clearly demarcated across the digit. They may be triphasic (pallor, followed bycyanosis and after warming by erythema due to reactive hyperemia), biphasic (cyanosis, erythema), oruniphasic (pallor or cyanosis only). Changes are often symmetric. Raynaud's syndrome does not occurproximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints; it most commonly affects the middle 3 fingers and rarelyaffects the thumb.

Sympathectomy often abolishes the symptoms, but relief may last only 1 to 2 yr.\\nThromboangiitis Obliterans\\n(Buerger's Disease)\\nThromboangiitis obliterans is inflammatory thrombosis of small and medium-sized arteries andsome superficial veins, causing arterial ischemia in distal extremities and superficialthrombophlebitis. Tobacco use is the primary risk factor. Symptoms and signs includeclaudication, nonhealing foot ulcers, rest pain, and gangrene. Diagnosis is by clinical findings,noninvasive vascular testing, angiography, and exclusion of other causes. Treatment iscessation of tobacco use. Prognosis is excellent when tobacco use is stopped, but when it isnot, the disorder inevitably progresses, often requiring amputation.\\nThromboangiitis obliterans occurs almost exclusively in tobacco users (nearly all of them smokers) andpredominantly affects men aged 20 to 40; it rarely occurs in women. It occurs more commonly in peoplewith HLAA9 and HLA-B5 genotypes. Prevalence is highest in Asia and the Far and Middle East.\\nThromboangiitis obliterans produces segmental inflammation in small and medium-sized arteries and,frequently, in superficial veins of the extremities. In acute thromboangiitis obliterans, occlusive thrombiaccompany neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltration of the intima; endothelial cells proliferate, but theinternal elastic lamina remains intact. In an intermediate phase, thrombi organize and recanalizeincompletely; the media is preserved but may be infiltrated with fibroblasts. In older lesions, periarterialfibrosis may occur, sometimes affecting the adjacent vein and nerve.\\nThe cause is unknown, although cigarette smoking is a primary risk factor. The mechanism may involvedelayed hypersensitivity or toxic angiitis. According to another theory, thromboangiitis obliterans may bean autoimmune disorder caused by cell-mediated sensitivity to types I and III human collagen, which areconstituents of blood vessels.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSymptoms and signs are those of arterial ischemia and superficial thrombophlebitis. Some patients havea history of migratory phlebitis, usually in the superficial veins of a foot or leg.\\nOnset is gradual, starting in the most distal vessels of the upper and lower extremities with coldness,numbness, tingling, or burning. These symptoms may develop before objective evidence of disease.Raynaud's syndrome is common. Intermittent claudication occurs in the affected extremity (usually in thearch of the foot or in the leg; rarely in the hand, arm, or thigh) and may progress to rest pain. Frequently,if pain is severe and persistent, the affected leg feels cold, sweats excessively, and becomes cyanotic,probably because of sympathetic nerve overactivity. Later, ischemic ulcers develop in most patients andmay progress to gangrene.\\nPulses are impaired or absent in one or more pedal arteries and often at the wrist. In young men whosmoke and have extremity ulcers, a positive Allen's test (the hand remains pale after the examinersimultaneously compresses the radial and ulnar arteries, then alternately releases them) suggests thedisorder. Pallor with elevation and rubor with dependency frequently occur in affected hands, feet, ordigits. Ischemic ulceration and gangrene, usually of one or more digits, may occur early in the disorderbut not acutely.

Peripheral Venous and Lymphatic Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nVenous and lymphatic disorders usually involve impairment of flow, abnormal vessel dilation, or both.\\nDeep Venous Thrombosis\\nDeep venous thrombosis (DVT) is clotting of blood in a deep vein of an extremity (usually calfor thigh) or the pelvis. DVT is the primary cause of pulmonary embolism. DVT results fromconditions that impair venous return, lead to endothelial injury or dysfunction, or causehypercoagulability. DVT may be asymptomatic or cause pain and swelling in an extremity.Diagnosis is by history, physical examination, and duplex ultrasonography, with D-dimer orother testing as necessary. Treatment is with anticoagulants. Prognosis is generally good withprompt, adequate treatment. Common long-term complications include venous insufficiencywith or without postphlebitic syndrome.\\nDVT occurs most commonly occurs in the lower extremities, or pelvis (seeFig. 219-1). It can also develop in deep veins of the upper extremities (4 to 13% of DVT cases).\\nLower extremity DVT is much more likely to cause pulmonary embolism (PE), possibly because of thehigher clot burden. The superficial femoral and popliteal veins in the thighs and the posterior tibial veinsin the calves are most commonly affected. Calf vein DVT is less likely to be a source of large emboli butcan cause repeated showers of small emboli or propagate to the proximal thigh veins and from therecause PE. About 50% of patients with DVT have occult PE, and at least 30% with PE have demonstrableDVT.\\nEtiology\\nMany factors can contribute to DVT (seeTable 219-1). Cancer is a risk factor for DVT, particularly in elderly patients and in patients with recurrentthrombosis. The association is strongest for mucin-secreting endothelial cell tumors. Occult cancers maybe present in patients with apparently idiopathic DVT, but extensive workup of patients for tumors is notrecommended.\\nPathophysiology\\nLower extremity DVT most often results from impaired venous return (eg, in immobilized patients),endothelial injury or dysfunction (eg, after leg fractures), or hypercoagulability.\\nUpper extremity DVT most often results from endothelial injury due to central venous catheters,pacemakers, or injection drug use. Upper extremity DVT occasionally occurs as part of superior venacava (SVC) syndrome or results from a hypercoagulable state or subclavian vein compression at thethoracic outlet. The compression may be due to a normal or an accessory first rib or fibrous band(thoracic outlet syndrome) or occur during strenuous arm activity (effort thrombosis, or Paget Schroettersyndrome, which accounts for 1 to 4% of upper extremity DVT cases).\\n[Fig. 219-1. Deep veins of the legs.]\\nDVT usually begins in venous valve cusps. Thrombi consist of thrombin, fibrin, and RBCs with relativelyfew platelets (red thrombi); without treatment, thrombi may propagate proximally or travel to the lungs.\\nComplications: Common complications include chronic venous insufficiency and postphlebiticsyndrome, as well as PE.\\nMuch less commonly, acute DVT leads to phlegmasia alba dolens or phlegmasia cerulea dolens, both ofwhich, unless promptly diagnosed and treated, can result in venous gangrene.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 219.

Pathophysiology may involvecomplete stasis of venous and arterial blood flow in the lower extremity because venous return isoccluded or massive edema cuts off arterial blood flow. Venous gangrene may result.\\nRarely, venous clots can become infected.

Suppurative (septic) thrombophlebitis, a bacterial infection ofa superficial peripheral vein, is infection and clotting usually caused by venous catheterization.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nDVT may occur in ambulatory patients or as a complication of surgery or major medical illness. Amonghigh-risk hospitalized patients, most deep vein thrombi occur in the small calf veins, are asymptomatic,and are never detected.\\nWhen present, symptoms and signs (eg, vague aching pain, tenderness along the distribution of theveins, edema, erythema) are nonspecific, vary in frequency and severity, and are similar in arms and legs.Dilated collateral superficial veins may become visible or palpable. Calf discomfort elicited by ankledorsiflexion with the knee extended (Homans' sign) occasionally occurs with distal leg DVT but is neithersensitive nor specific. Tenderness, swelling of the whole leg, > 3 cm difference in circumference betweencalves, pitting edema, and collateral superficial veins may be most specific; DVT is likely with acombination of ≥ 3 in the absence of another likely diagnosis (seeTable 219-2).\\nLow-grade fever may be present; DVT may be the cause of fever without an obvious source, especially inpostoperative patients. If PE occurs, symptoms may include shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain(see p. 1909).\\nCommon causes of asymmetric leg swelling that mimic DVT are soft-tissue trauma, cellulitis, pelvicvenous or lymphatic obstruction, and popliteal bursitis (Baker's cyst) that obstructs venous return.Abdominal or pelvic tumors that obstruct venous or lymphatic return are less common causes.

The needfor additional tests (eg, D-dimer testing) and their choice and sequence depend on pretest probability andsometimes ultrasonography results. No single testing protocol is best; one approach is described inFig. 219-2.\\nUltrasonography: Ultrasonography identifies thrombi by directly visualizing the venous lining and bydemonstrating abnormal vein compressibility or, with Doppler flow studies, impaired venous flow. The testis > 90% sensitive and > 95% specific for femoral and popliteal vein thrombosis but is less accurate foriliac or calf vein thrombosis.\\nD-Dimer: D-Dimer is a byproduct of fibrinolysis; elevated levels suggest recent presence\\n[Fig. 219-2. One approach to testing for suspected deep venous thrombosis.]\\nand lysis of thrombi. D-dimer assays vary in sensitivity and specificity; however, most are sensitive andnot specific. Only the most accurate tests should be used. For example, a highly sensitive test is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which has a sensitivity of about 95%.\\nIf pretest probability of DVT is low, DVT can be safely excluded in patients with a normal D-dimer level ona sensitive test. Thus, a negative D-dimer test can identify patients who have a low probability of DVTand do not require ultrasonography. However, a positive test result is nonspecific; because levels can beelevated by other conditions (eg, liver disease, trauma, pregnancy, positive rheumatoid factor,inflammation, recent surgery, cancer), further testing is necessary.\\nIf pretest probability of DVT is moderate or high, D-dimer testing can be done at the same time as duplexultrasonography. A positive ultrasound result confirms the diagnosis regardless of the D-dimer level. Ifultrasonography does not reveal evidence of DVT, a normal D-dimer level helps exclude DVT. Patientswith an elevated D-dimer level should have repeat ultrasonography in a few days or possibly immediatevenography depending on clinical suspicion. Newer latex qualitative assays are highly specific (up toabout 99%) but should not yet be used to confirm DVT without ultrasonography.\\nVenography: Contrast venography was the definitive test for the diagnosis of DVT but has been largelyreplaced by ultrasonography, which is noninvasive, more readily available, and almost equally accuratefor detecting DVT. Venography may be indicated when ultrasonography results are normal but pretestsuspicion for DVT is high. The complication rate is 2%, mostly because of contrast dye allergy.\\nOther testing: Noninvasive alternatives to contrast venography are being studied. They includemagnetic resonance venography and direct MRI of thrombi using T1-weighted gradient-echo sequencingand a water-excitation radiofrequency pulse; theoretically, the latter test can provide simultaneous viewsof thrombi in deep veins and subsegmental pulmonary arteries (for diagnosis of PE).\\nIf symptoms and signs suggest PE, additional imaging (eg, ventilation/perfusion [V/Q] scanning or helicalCT) is required.\\nDetermination of cause: Patients with confirmed DVT and an obvious cause (eg, immobilization,surgical procedure, leg trauma) need no further testing. Testing to detect hypercoagulability iscontroversial but is sometimes done in patients who have idiopathic recurrent DVT, in patients who havea personal or family history of other thromboses, and in young patients with no obvious predisposingfactors. Some evidence suggests that presence of hypercoagulability does not predict DVT recurrence aswell as clinical risk factors.\\nScreening patients with DVT for cancer has a low yield. Selective testing guided by complete history andphysical examination aimed at detecting cancer is probably adequate.\\nPrognosis\\nWithout adequate treatment, lower extremity DVT has a 3% risk of fatal PE; death due to upper extremity\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 219.

Risk of recurrent DVT is lowest for patients with transient risk factors (eg, surgery,trauma, temporary immobility) and greatest for patients with persistent risk factors (eg, heart failure,cancer), idiopathic DVT, or incomplete resolution of past DVT (residual thrombus). A normal D-dimer levelobtained after warfarin is stopped may help predict a relatively low risk of DVT or PE recurrence. Risk ofvenous insufficiency is impossible to predict. Risk factors for post-phlebitic syndrome include proximalthrombosis, recurrent ipsilateral DVT, and body mass index (BMI) ≥ 22 kg/m2.\\nTreatment\\n• Anticoagulation\\nTreatment is aimed primarily at PE prevention (see also p. 1920) and secondarily at symptom relief andprevention of DVT recurrence, chronic venous insufficiency, and post-phlebitic syndrome. Treatment oflower and upper extremity DVT is generally the same.\\nAll patients with DVT are given anticoagulants, initially an injectable heparin (unfractionated or lowmolecular weight), followed by warfarin started within 24 to 48 h. Inadequate anticoagulation in the first 24h may increase risk of recurrence or PE. Acute DVT can be treated on an outpatient basis unless severesymptoms require parenteral analgesics, other disorders preclude safe outpatient discharge, or otherfactors (eg, functional, socioeconomic) might prevent the patient from adhering to prescribed treatments.General supportive measures include pain control with analgesics other than aspirin and NSAIDs(because of their antiplatelet effects) and, during periods of inactivity, elevation of legs (supported by apillow or other soft surface to avoid venous compression). Patients may be as physically active as theycan tolerate; there is no evidence that early activity increases risk of clot dislodgement and PE.\\nAnticoagulants: The anticoagulants most often used are the following:\\n• Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs)\\n• Unfractionated heparin (UFH)\\n• Fondaparinux\\n• Warfarin\\nLMWHs (eg, enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin—seeTable 194-3 on p. 1917) are the initial treatment of choice because they can be given on an outpatientbasis. LMWHs are as effective as UFH for reducing DVT recurrence, thrombus extension, and risk ofdeath due to PE. Like UFH, LMWHs catalyze the action of antithrombin (which inhibits coagulation factorproteases), leading to inactivation of coagulation factor Xa and, to a lesser degree, factor IIa. LMWHsalso have some antithrombin-mediated anti-inflammatory properties, which facilitate clot organization andresolution of symptoms and inflammation.\\nLMWHs are typically given sc in a standard weight-based dose (eg, enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg sc once/day or1 mg/kg sc q 12 h or dalteparin 200 units/kg sc once/day). Patients with renal insufficiency may be treatedwith UFH or with reduced doses of LMWH. Monitoring is not reliable because LMWHs do not significantlyprolong the results of global tests of coagulation. Furthermore, they have a predictable dose response,and there is no clear relationship between LMWH overdose and bleeding. Treatment is continued until fullanticoagulation is achieved with warfarin. However, evidence suggests that LMWH is effective for long-term DVT treatment in high-risk patients, such as those with cancer. Thus, LMWH may become anacceptable alternative to warfarin for some patients, although warfarin is likely to be the treatment ofchoice for most patients because of its low cost and oral route of administration.\\nUFH may be used instead of LMWH for hospitalized patients and for patients who have renalinsufficiency or failure (creatinine clearance 10 to 30 mL/min) because UFH is not cleared by the kidneys.UFH is given as a bolus and infusion (seeFig. 194-2 on p. 1916) to achieve full anticoagulation, (eg, activated PTT [aPTT] 1.5 to 2.5 times that ofthe reference range). UFH 333 units/kg initial bolus, then 250 units/kg sc q 12 h can be substituted for IV\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 219.

Long-term use of UFH causes hypokalemia, liver enzyme elevations,and osteoporosis. Rarely, UFH given sc causes skin necrosis. Inpatients and possibly outpatients shouldbe screened for bleeding with serial CBCs and tests for occult blood in stool. Bleeding due tooverheparinization can be stopped with protamine sulfate. The dose is 1 mg protamine for each milligramof LMWH given as 1 mg in 20 mL of normal saline infused slowly over 10 to 20 min. If a 2nd dose isrequired, it should be at one half the first dose. However, the precise dose is undefined becauseprotamine only partially neutralizes LMWH inactivation of factor Xa. With all infusions, the patient shouldbe observed for hypotension and a reaction similar to an anaphylactic reaction. Because UFH given IVhas a half-life of 30 to 60 min, protamine is not given to patients receiving UFH (eg, if UFH was given >60 min beforehand) or is given at a dose based on the amount of heparin estimated to be remaining inplasma, based on the half-life of UFH.\\nFondaparinux, a selective factor Xa inhibitor, may be used as an alternative to UFH or LMWH for theinitial treatment of DVT or PE. It is given in a fixed dose of 7.5 mg sc once/day (10 mg for patients > 100kg, 5 mg for patients < 50 kg). It has the advantage of fixed dosing and is less likely to causethrombocytopenia.\\nVitamin K antagonists, including warfarin, are the drugs of choice for long-term anticoagulation for allpatients except pregnant women (who should continue to take heparin) and patients who have had newor worsening venous thromboembolism during warfarin treatment (who may be candidates for an inferiorvena cava filter). Warfarin 5 to 10 mg can be started immediately with heparin. The elderly and patientswith a liver disorder typically require lower warfarin doses. Therapeutic goal is an INR of 2.0 to 3.0. INR ismonitored weekly for the first 1 to 2 mo of warfarin treatment and monthly thereafter; the dose isincreased or decreased by 0.5 to 3 mg to maintain the INR within this range. Patients taking warfarinshould be informed of possible drug interactions, including interactions with foods and nonprescriptionmedicinal herbs (seeTable 194-4 on p. 1917).\\nPatients with transient risk factors for DVT (eg, immobilization, surgery) can stop taking warfarin after 3 to6 mo. Patients with non-modifiable risk factors (eg, hypercoagulability), spontaneous DVT with no knownrisk factors, or recurrent DVT should take warfarin for at least 6 mo and probably for life unlesscomplications occur.\\nBleeding is the most common complication. Risk factors for severe bleeding (defined as life-threateninghemorrhage or loss of ≥ 2 units of blood in ≤ 7 days) include age ≥ 65; history of prior GI bleeding orstroke; recent MI; and coexisting anemia (Hct < 30%), renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL),or diabetes. Anticoagulation can be reversed with vitamin K; the dose is 1 to 4 mg po if INR is 5 to 9, 5 mgpo if INR is > 9, and 10 mg IV (given slowly to avoid anaphylaxis) if hemorrhage occurs. If hemorrhage issevere, a transfusion of coagulation factors, fresh frozen plasma, or prothrombin complex concentrateshould also be given. Overanticoagulation (INR > 3 or 4) without bleeding can be managed by omittingseveral warfarin doses and more frequent INR monitoring, then giving warfarin at a lower dose. Rarely,warfarin causes skin necrosis in patients with protein C or S deficiency or factor V Leiden mutations.\\nOther anticoagulants, such as direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs, eg, hirudin given sc; lepirudin, bivalirudin,desirudin, argatroban, given parenterally; dabigatran given po) and oral factor Xa inhibitors (eg,rivaroxaban and apixaban) are being evaluated for the treatment of DVT (seeTable 194-6 on p. 1921).\\nInferior vena cava filter (IVCF): An IVCF may help prevent PE in patients with lower extremity DVT andcontraindications to anticoagulants or with recurrent DVT (or emboli) despite adequate anticoagulation.An IVCF is placed in the inferior vena cava just below the renal veins via catheterization of an internaljugular or femoral vein. Some IVCFs are removable and can be used temporarily (eg, untilcontraindications to anticoagulation subside or resolve). IVCFs reduce risk of acute and subacutethrombotic complications but can have longer-term complications (eg, venous collaterals can develop,\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th EditionChapter 219.

Also, IVCFs can dislodge or become obstructedby clot. Thus, patients with recurrent DVT or nonmodifiable risk factors for DVT may still requireanticoagulation. A clotted filter may cause bilateral lower extremity venous congestion (including acutephlegmasia cerulea dolens), lower body ischemia, and acute renal failure. Treatment for a dislodged filteris removal, using angiographic, or, if necessary, surgical methods. Despite widespread use of IVCFs,efficacy in preventing PE is unstudied and unproved.\\nThrombolytic (fibrinolytic) drugs: Streptokinase, urokinase, and alteplase lyse clots and appear tomore effectively prevent post-phlebitic syndrome than heparin alone, but risk of bleeding is higher. Theiruse is under study. Thrombolytics may be indicated for large proximal thrombi, especially those in theiliofemoral veins, and for phlegmasia alba or cerulea dolens. Local perfusion with an indwelling cathetermay be preferable to IV administration.\\nSurgery: Surgery is rarely needed. However, thrombectomy, fasciotomy, or both are mandatory forphlegmasia alba or cerulea dolens unresponsive to thrombolytics to try to prevent limb-threateninggangrene.\\nPrevention\\n• Prevention of immobility\\n• Assessment of risk\\n• Anticoagulation (eg, LMWH, fondaparinux, adjusted-dose warfarin)\\n• Intermittent pneumatic compression\\n• IVCF\\nPatients at low risk of DVT (eg, those who are undergoing minor surgery but have no clinical risk factorsfor DVT; those who must be temporarily inactive for long periods, as during an airplane flight) should beencouraged to walk or otherwise move their legs periodically; no medical treatment is needed.Dorsiflexion 10 times/h is probably sufficient.\\nPatients at higher risk of DVT (eg, those undergoing minor surgery if they have clinical risk factors forDVT; those undergoing major surgery, especially orthopedic surgery, even without risk factors; bedboundpatients with major medical illnesses) require additional preventive treatment (seeTable 194-5 on p. 1920). Most of these patients can be identified and should receive thrombosisprophylaxis.\\nAfter surgery, elevating the legs and avoiding sitting in chairs (which, by placing the legs in a dependentposition, impedes venous return) can help. Additional treatment may involve low-dose UFH, LMWH,warfarin, newer anticoagulants such as fondaparinux, compression devices or stockings, or acombination, depending on patient's risk level, type of surgery (if applicable), projected duration ofpreventive treatment, contraindications, adverse effects, relative cost, ease of use, and local practice.Low-dose UFH 5000 units sc is given 2 h before surgery and q 8 to 12 h thereafter for 7 to 10 days oruntil patients are fully ambulatory. Bedbound patients who are not undergoing surgery are given 5000units sc q 12 h until risk factors are reversed.\\nLMWHs are more effective than low-dose UFH for preventing DVT and PE, but widespread use is limitedby cost. For example, enoxaparin 30 mg sc q 12 h, dalteparin 2500 units once/day, and tinzaparin 3500units once/day are equally effective. Fondaparinux, 2.5 mg once/day, is equal to or more effective thanLMWH depending on the surgical setting (eg, orthopedic surgery).\\nWarfarin, using a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0, is proven to be effective in orthopedic surgery.\\nNewer anticoagulants (eg, hirudin, lepirudin) are effective for preventing DVT and PE, but their cost-effectiveness and safety compared with heparin and warfarin require further study.

IPC may be usedinstead of or with anticoagulants before and during surgery. IPC is recommended after knee surgery. IPCis probably more effective for preventing calf than proximal DVT. IPC is usually contraindicated in obesepatients and can theoretically trigger PE in immobilized patients who, without preventive treatment,develop occult DVT.\\nThe benefit of graded compression stockings is questionable except for low-risk surgical patients.However, combining stockings with other preventive measures may be more protective than any singleapproach.\\nFor elective neurosurgery, spinal cord injury, or multiple trauma, low-dose UFH (q 8 h), LMWH, oradjusted-dose warfarin is recommended. For hip and other lower extremity orthopedic surgery, LMWH,fondaparinux, or adjusted-dose warfarin is recommended. For patients undergoing total knee replacementand some other high-risk patients, IPC is also beneficial. For orthopedic surgery, preventive treatmentmay be started before or after surgery and continued for at least 14 days. Fondaparinux 2.5 mg once/dayis more effective than LMWH for orthopedic surgery. For neurosurgery patients, physical measures (IPC,elastic stockings) have been used because intracranial bleeding is a concern; however, LMWH appearsto be an acceptable alternative.

Postphlebitic (postthrombotic) syndrome is symptomaticchronic venous insufficiency after deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Causes of chronic venousinsufficiency are disorders that result in venous hypertension, usually through venous damageor incompetence of venous valves, as occurs (for example) after DVT. Diagnosis is by history,physical examination, and duplex ultrasonography. Treatment is compression, wound care, and,rarely, surgery. Prevention requires adequate treatment of DVT and compression stockings.\\nChronic venous insufficiency affects up to 5% of people in the US. Postphlebitic syndrome may affect onefifth to two thirds of patients with DVT, usually within 1 to 2 yr after acute DVT.\\nEtiology\\nVenous return from the lower extremities relies on contraction of calf muscles to push blood fromintramuscular (soleal) sinusoids and gastrocnemius veins into and through deep veins.

       "\"Okay, let's analyze the provided context and formulate possible diagnoses and medications based on the information.\\n\\n**Possible Diseases and Medications:**\\n\\nGiven the patient's history and presented symptoms (generalized, slowly developing edema), here’s a breakdown of potential diagnoses and potential medication suggestions:\\n\\n**1. Possible Diseases & Conditions:**\\n\\n*   **Heart Failure:** The history of edema, coupled with the gradual onset and potentially slow development, strongly points towards heart failure. The underlying heart condition could be causing impaired venous return, leading to edema.\\n*   **Liver Disease:**  Edema can be a symptom of various liver conditions, including cirrhosis, hepatitis, or dysfunction. The history of chronic alcohol abuse or kidney disorders needs consideration.\\n*   **Kidney Disease:** Similar to liver disease, kidney dysfunction can contribute to edema.  The history of kidney disorders, coupled with the gradual onset, warrants investigation.\\n*   **Cancer (especially Mucin-secreting endothelial cell tumors):** The increased risk for DVT, particularly in elderly patients, and recurrent thrombosis, suggests this as a possibility.  It's crucial to rule out a malignancy.\\n*   **Other Cardiac Conditions:**  While less likely given the gradual onset, cardiac conditions can also manifest with edema.\\n\\n**2. Medication Suggestions (Based on Potential Causes):**\\n\\n*   **For Heart Failure:**\\n    *   Diuretics (to reduce fluid retention)\\n    *   ACE inhibitors/ARBs (if there’s a history of hypertension)\\n    *   Beta-blockers (if there's a history of arrhythmias)\\n*   **For Liver Disease:**\\n    *   Antiviral medications (if Hepatitis is suspected)\\n    *   Managing underlying conditions like cirrhosis (with careful monitoring)\\n*   **For Kidney Disease:**\\n    *   ACE inhibitors/ARBs (if there's a history of hypertension)\\n    *   Diuretics\\n    *   Managing underlying conditions like renal failure (with careful monitoring)\\n*   **For Cancer (Mucin-secreting Endothelial Cell Tumors):**\\n    *   Chemotherapy (depending on the specific tumor type and stage) – *This would be a crucial consideration.*\\n    *   Targeted therapy (if the tumor has a specific molecular profile)\\n*   **General Management:**\\n    *   Sodium restriction (to manage fluid retention)\\n    *   Fluid management (based on edema severity and lab results)\\n\\n**Important Considerations & Next Steps (Based on Context):**\\n\\n*   **Detailed History:**  The patient's complete medical history, including details about medications, alcohol consumption, any past surgeries or radiation therapy, and any family history of heart disease or cancer are absolutely essential.\\n*   **Physical Exam:** A thorough physical exam, focusing on edema distribution, skin color, and pulses, is required.  Specifically, assessing for peripheral pulses and noting the extent of edema is vital.\\n*   **Investigations:**\\n    *   Complete Blood Count (CBC)\\n    *   Electrolyte Panel (including sodium, potassium, BUN, creatinine)\\n    *   Liver Function Tests (LFTs)\\n    *   Urinalysis (to look for protein and hematuria)\\n    *   Consider BNP (if heart failure is suspected)\\n    *   Imaging (CT scan or ultrasound) - to evaluate for cardiac issues, vascular obstructions, or other structural problems.\\n\\n**Disclaimer:** *I am an AI Chatbot and not a medical professional. This information is for general knowledge and informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical advice. It is essential to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.*\\n\\nTo help me refine my response and provide more targeted advice, could you tell me:\\n\\n*   Is there any specific information you'd like me to focus on (e.g., is this a patient with a known history of heart failure, or is it a more general case)?\""
